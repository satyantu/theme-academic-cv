abstract: OFMSW consists mainly of food waste, with small proportions of the yard
  and paper waste, composed of bio-polymers-lignin, cellulose, and hemicellu-lose,
  whose cross-linkage leads to difficulty in enzyme degradation thus reduce the overall
  process efficiency. Thermal pretreatment helps in the breakage of the lignin bonds
  and breaks down the crystalline structure of cellulose, leading to solubiliza-tion
  of COD, proteins, carbohydrates of OFMSW, higher biogas yield, and volatile solid
  removal during anaerobic digestion. This chapter concentrates on the temperature
  phase treatment and thermal pretreatment (conventional, microwave, and thermo-chemical),
  their principle, and their effect on process efficiency. Along with it, the merits,
  demerits of thermal pre/treatment, production of inhibitory compounds, and their
  effect on AD have been discussed. Furthermore, the commercial application, economic
  and environmental feasibility of thermal pretreatment of OFMSW has also been covered
  in this chapter. Keywords Organic fraction of municipal solid waste · Temperature
