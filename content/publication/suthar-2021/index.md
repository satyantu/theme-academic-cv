abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global issue
  of concern for public health, environment and socioeconomic setup. This review addresses
  several aspects of epidemiology, and pathogen-esis, environmental resource quality
  (air quality, hazardous waste management, and wastewater surveillance issues), and
  socioeconomic issues worldwide. The accelerated research activity in the development
  of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various
  strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has
  been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities
  in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation,
  and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous
  wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission
  of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data
  source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial
  socioeconomic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment)
  and further aggravated the countries' economic burden.
