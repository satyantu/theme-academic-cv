 abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global issue of concern for public health, environment and socioeconomic setup. This review addresses several aspects of epidemiology, and pathogen-esis, environmental resource quality (air quality, hazardous waste management, and wastewater surveillance issues), and socioeconomic issues worldwide. The accelerated research activity in the development of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation, and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial socioeconomic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment) and further aggravated the countries' economic burden.},
