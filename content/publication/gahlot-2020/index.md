abstract: Biological syntrophy can be defined as a nutritional condition where various
  syntrophic microorganisms mutually synergize their metabolic activities to break
  down complex organic substrates that cannot be otherwise catabolized by either individually.
  Direct interspecies electrons transfer (DIET) is a syntrophic metabolism wherein
  free electrons flow from one cell to another through shared physical, electrical
  connections without the requirement of reduced electron carriers (redox mediators)
  like molecular hydrogen or formate or protein released after cell death. In anaerobic
  digestion (AD), the transfer of electrons between two different syntrophic microbial
  communities such as bacteria and archaea is a vital process for methanogens to get
  control of energy barriers and catabolize complex organics which could not be digested
  by them alone. Studies conducted so far show that DIET can be accelerated by conductive
  materials like carbon nanotubes, biochar, carbon cloth, granular activated carbon
  (GAC), and magnetite. The conductive materials mediated DIET has showed to be highly
  efficient in enhancement of methane yield than indirect interspecies electron transfer
  (IIET) in case of conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) process. This review summarizes
  the studies conducted to date on the effect of conductive materials mediated DIET
  on methanogenesis in the AD. The different types and concentrations of conducting
  materials affecting (a) DIET, (b) major microbial communities required for carrying
  out DIET, and (c) the rate of methanation, are critically discussed in the review.
