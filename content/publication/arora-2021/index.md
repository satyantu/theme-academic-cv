abstract: The present study investigated the detection of severe acute respiratory
  syndromeâ€“coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes at each treatment stage of 14 aerobic
  wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities in two states
  of Rajasthan and Uttarakhand in Northern India. The untreated, primary, secondary
  and tertiary treated wastewater samples were collected over a time frame ranging
  from under-lockdown to post-lockdown conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2
  RNA was detected in 13 out of 40 wastewater samples in Jaipur district, Rajasthan
  and in 5 out of 14 wastewater samples in the Haridwar District, Uttarakhand with
  the E gene predominantly observed as compared to the N and RdRp target genes in
  later time-points of sampling. The Ct values of genes present in wastewater samples
  were correlated with the incidence of patient and community cases of COVID-19. This
  study further indicates that the viral RNA could be detected after the primary treatment
  but was not present in secondary or tertiary treated samples. This study implies
  that aerobic biological wastewater treatment systems such as moving bed biofilm
  reactor (MBBR) technology and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) are effective in virus
  removal from the wastewater. This work might present a new indication that there
  is little to no risk in relation to SARS-CoV-2 while reusing the treated wastewater
  for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater might present a
  potential route of viral transmission through WWTPs to sanitation workers and the
  public. However, there is a need to investigate the survival and infection rates
  of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.
