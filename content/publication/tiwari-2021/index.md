abstract: 'Management of agro-waste is a major challenge globally due to inefficient
  disposal techniques, which concominantly leads pollution and loss of renewable bioenergy.
  Anaerobic digestion of agro-waste is one of the ways to tackle this problem but
  hindered by the recalcitrant nature of agro-waste. This study investigated the effect
  of granular activated carbon (GAC) and granular biochar (GBC) addition to enhance
  the thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion of wheat husk and sewage sludge. The conductive
  materials (particle size: 2â€“5 mm) were added separately at five different concentrations:
  10, 20, 30, 40, 50 g/ Linoculum. The findings revealed that samples amended with
  GAC and GBC at 20 g/L dosage had the highest biogas yield of 263 and 273 mL/gVSadded,
  respectively, corresponding to 22 and 27% higher yield than the control. Additionally,
  a shorter lag phase was observed in both cases compared to the Control. However,
  the GBC amended samples showed relatively stable biogas production compared to GAC
  and consistent results regarding pH, alkalinity, total volatile fatty acids, and
  soluble chemical oxygen demand. The pre- liminary techno-economic analysis indicates
  that addition of GAC or GBC may not be feasible and require other innovative engineered
  solutions for the addition of conductive materials. This study confirms that GAC
  and GBC amendments enhance the biogas productivity and process stability in anaerobic
  digestion of recalcitrant agro-waste under the high-temperature regime and calls
  for further research in this direction'
