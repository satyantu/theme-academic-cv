	abstract = {Biological syntrophy can be defined as a nutritional condition where various syntrophic microorganisms mutually synergize their metabolic activities to break down complex organic substrates that cannot be otherwise catabolized by either individually. Direct interspecies electrons transfer (DIET) is a syntrophic metabolism wherein free electrons flow from one cell to another through shared physical, electrical connections without the requirement of reduced electron carriers (redox mediators) like molecular hydrogen or formate or protein released after cell death. In anaerobic digestion (AD), the transfer of electrons between two different syntrophic microbial communities such as bacteria and archaea is a vital process for methanogens to get control of energy barriers and catabolize complex organics which could not be digested by them alone. Studies conducted so far show that DIET can be accelerated by conductive materials like carbon nanotubes, biochar, carbon cloth, granular activated carbon (GAC), and magnetite. The conductive materials mediated DIET has showed to be highly efficient in enhancement of methane yield than indirect interspecies electron transfer (IIET) in case of conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) process. This review summarizes the studies conducted to date on the effect of conductive materials mediated DIET on methanogenesis in the AD. The different types and concentrations of conducting materials affecting (a) DIET, (b) major microbial communities required for carrying out DIET, and (c) the rate of methanation, are critically discussed in the review.},

	abstract = {OFMSW consists mainly of food waste, with small proportions of the yard and paper waste, composed of bio-polymers-lignin, cellulose, and hemicellu-lose, whose cross-linkage leads to difficulty in enzyme degradation thus reduce the overall process efficiency. Thermal pretreatment helps in the breakage of the lignin bonds and breaks down the crystalline structure of cellulose, leading to solubiliza-tion of COD, proteins, carbohydrates of OFMSW, higher biogas yield, and volatile solid removal during anaerobic digestion. This chapter concentrates on the temperature phase treatment and thermal pretreatment (conventional, microwave, and thermo-chemical), their principle, and their effect on process efficiency. Along with it, the merits, demerits of thermal pre/treatment, production of inhibitory compounds, and their effect on AD have been discussed. Furthermore, the commercial application, economic and environmental feasibility of thermal pretreatment of OFMSW has also been covered in this chapter.

	abstract = {Management of agro-waste is a major challenge globally due to inefficient disposal techniques, which concominantly leads pollution and loss of renewable bioenergy. Anaerobic digestion of agro-waste is one of the ways to tackle this problem but hindered by the recalcitrant nature of agro-waste. This study investigated the effect of granular activated carbon (GAC) and granular biochar (GBC) addition to enhance the thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion of wheat husk and sewage sludge. The conductive materials (particle size: 2–5 mm) were added separately at five different concentrations: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 g/ Linoculum. The findings revealed that samples amended with GAC and GBC at 20 g/L dosage had the highest biogas yield of 263 and 273 mL/gVSadded, respectively, corresponding to 22 and 27\% higher yield than the control. Additionally, a shorter lag phase was observed in both cases compared to the Control. However, the GBC amended samples showed relatively stable biogas production compared to GAC and consistent results regarding pH, alkalinity, total volatile fatty acids, and soluble chemical oxygen demand. The pre- liminary techno-economic analysis indicates that addition of GAC or GBC may not be feasible and require other innovative engineered solutions for the addition of conductive materials. This study confirms that GAC and GBC amendments enhance the biogas productivity and process stability in anaerobic digestion of recalcitrant agro-waste under the high-temperature regime and calls for further research in this direction},

	abstract = {The present work summarizes the major research findings related to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) study of COVID-19 and puts forward a conceptual framework, termed as "Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP)" for implementation of WBE. SWEEP framework is likely to tackle few practical issues related to WBE and simultaneously proposes refinements to the approach for better outcome and efficiency to save precious lives around the globe. It is observed that the present pandemic offers an opportunity for SWEEP to get included in routine urban water management to put the humankind at front to stop such pandemic in future or at least be prepared to fight against it. With global collaboration, SWEEP can be fine-tuned to meet diverse needs, making the present and future generations resilient to future viral outbreaks. Recent WBE studies conducted to check for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater revealed that raw sewage samples tested positive to PCR-based assays while the treated samples showed absence of viral titers. Moreover, the lockdown had a positive impact on decreasing the viral loading in sewage. The proposed SWEEP protocol has an advantage over testifying individuals for predicting the stage of pandemic.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global issue of concern for public health, environment and socioeconomic setup. This review addresses several aspects of epidemiology, and pathogen-esis, environmental resource quality (air quality, hazardous waste management, and wastewater surveillance issues), and socioeconomic issues worldwide. The accelerated research activity in the development of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation, and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial socioeconomic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment) and further aggravated the countries' economic burden.},

	abstract = {The present study investigated the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes at each treatment stage of 14 aerobic wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities in two states of Rajasthan and Uttarakhand in Northern India. The untreated, primary, secondary and tertiary treated wastewater samples were collected over a time frame ranging from under-lockdown to post-lockdown conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 out of 40 wastewater samples in Jaipur district, Rajasthan and in 5 out of 14 wastewater samples in the Haridwar District, Uttarakhand with the E gene predominantly observed as compared to the N and RdRp target genes in later time-points of sampling. The Ct values of genes present in wastewater samples were correlated with the incidence of patient and community cases of COVID-19. This study further indicates that the viral RNA could be detected after the primary treatment but was not present in secondary or tertiary treated samples. This study implies that aerobic biological wastewater treatment systems such as moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) are effective in virus removal from the wastewater. This work might present a new indication that there is little to no risk in relation to SARS-CoV-2 while reusing the treated wastewater for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater might present a potential route of viral transmission through WWTPs to sanitation workers and the public. However, there is a need to investigate the survival and infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge (SS) is a reclaimable phosphorus (P) source for fertilizer production, but it has a high toxic trace element (TE) concentration. Using alkaline leaching of SS, P can be extracted without simultaneous extraction of TEs. However, low P recovery efficiency during alkaline leaching is a major challenge. This study explored alkaline leaching of P from alum sludge (AS)-amended dry SS, with or without acidic pretreatment. The amendment with AS was intended to promote apatite to non-apatite inorganic phosphorus conversion for a higher alkaline P recovery. The highest orthophosphate (ortho-P) alkaline recovery was 74 \% for the acid-pretreated SS + AS mix. Amending SS with AS averted the loss of ortho-P during acidic pretreatment by 59 \% compared to the reference case (unamended SS). Standards Measurements and Testing (SMT) analysis revealed apatite to non-apatite inorganic phosphorus conversion during acidic pretreatment, especially in the amended SS. This conversion was due to the dissolution of Ca-P and adsorption of dissolved ortho-P on Al(OH)3 during acidic pretreatment. Visual MINTEQ modelling, solid-state NMR (31P, 27Al and 31P-1H CP-HETCOR) and Al 2p XPS data indicated a high abundance of Al(OH)3(s), which enhanced the ortho-P adsorption. There was no formation of AlPO4, possibly because the acid-sludge mixture reached the metastable equilibrium and not the true equilibrium during acidic pretreatment. 31P liquid NMR, SEM, FTIR and XRD provided additional insight into the effects of acidic pretreatment on sludges. Overall, Ca-P to Al-P conversion enhanced alkaline ortho-P recovery by about 12 \% compared to the reference case (unamended + non-pretreated). This study demonstrated that P leaching efficiency from SS can be improved (with appropriate process modifications) irrespective of the intrinsic property of SS, thus making alkaline P recovery applicable in many regions globally. Additionally, the chemical co-treatment of SS + AS proposed is a prospective dual waste management strategy.},
