	abstract = {System stability and performance of high-solids anaerobic co-digestion of dewatered sludge (DS) and food waste (FW) in comparison with mono digestions were investigated. System stability was improved in co-digestion systems with co-substrate acting as a diluting agent to toxic chemicals like ammonia or Na+. For high-solids digestion of DS, the addition of FW not only improved system stability but also greatly enhanced volumetric biogas production. For high-solids digestion of FW, the addition of DS could reduce Na+ concentration and help maintain satisfactory stability during the conversion of FW into biogas. System performances of co-digestion systems were mainly determined by the mixing ratios of DS and FW. Biogas production and volatile solids (VSs) reduction in digestion of the co-mixture of DS and FW increased linearly with higher ratios of FW. A kinetic model, which aimed to forecast the performance of co-digestion and to assist reactor design, was developed from long-term semi-continuous experiments. Maximum VS reduction for DS and FW was estimated to be 44.3\% and 90.3\%, respectively, and first order constant k was found to be 0.17d-1 and 0.50d-1, respectively. Experimental data of co-digestion were in good conformity to the predictions of the model. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We also describe the process of reverse electron transfer, which is a key requirement in obligately syntrophic interactions. Anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulphate reduction is also carried out by syntrophic communities of bacteria and archaea but, as we discuss, the exact mechanism of this syntrophic interaction is not yet understood.},

However, it is not clear if carbon-based materials would have any interaction with ammonia on AD performance, especially when ammonia is above inhibition level. This study aims to explore the effects of ammonia on carbon nanotube assisted AD reactors. Methanogenic performance, intracellular energy production, potassium transport activity as well as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) changes were investigated. The results show that the presence of CNT may mitigate or worsen the ammonia inhibition depending on the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration. Further investigation found that potassium transportation process of the culture was disturbed with the presence of CNT, which dispatched the proton motive force. As a result, the intracellular energy level reduced, and the microbial detoxification capability decreased. TAN exhibited a strong positive correlation with microbes’ detoxification activity, and CNT concentration was positively correlated with polysaccharide which created a physical structure to protect cell membrane.},

This review evaluates methods believed to confirm the occurrence of DIET in anaerobic systems. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and meta-omics approaches are necessary to further DIET knowledge but are limited in their ability to confirm the occurrence of DIET. In situ use of cyclic voltammetry should be explored further, as well as microscopy and image analysis procedures to quantify stained cytochromes. Furthermore, linking interspecies distance, interspecies mixing, and cellular activity to a DIET-based electron transfer model is promising but needs further validation for anaerobic digestion systems. In short, a combination of methods is necessary to confirm the occurrence and expand our knowledge of DIET.},

The addition of GAC significantly reduced lag phases for methane production in comparison with the unamended control at both temperatures. Microbial community analyses revealed that GAC addition increased the diversity and richness of both bacterial and archaeal communities. Besides, several known or potential electroactive fermentative bacteria (e.g., Calorameter, Sporanaerobacter, Coprothermobacter, etc.) were found in GAC-amended bioreactors at both temperatures, suggesting the possibility of DIET-based syntrophy in these reactors. At mesophilic temperature, GAC amendment increased methane productivity (L CH4/kg-VS) by almost two-fold in comparison with the control; however, methane production at the thermophilic temperature was unaffected by GAC addition. These results indicate that enhanced process kinetics at thermophilic temperature might diminish the visible impact on methane productivity due to the addition of GAC.},

Syntrophic partners cooperate by transferring electrons from one species to the other using H2, formate or other pathways, and maintaining H2 at low levels, so that the overall reactions are thermodynamically more favorable. Here we reviewed the mechanisms of interspecies electron transfer involved in methanogenic consortia, i.e., interspecies H2 transfer, interspecies formate transfer, and direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) via pili, and/or outer membrane cytochromes. Although the relative importance of different mechanisms is uncertain, one mechanism may predominate under specific circumstances. Interspecies electron transfer is a probable mechanism in anaerobic granules formed in upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors, though direct evidence is limited. Studies of interspecies electron transfer without extracellular shuttles are mainly confined to Shewanella and Geobacter species. These mechanisms could be more energy-conserving than interspecies H2 or formate transfer, but the relationship between them is yet unelucidated. These studies are meaningful in that they could enable us a deeper understanding of how microorganisms degrade waste and produce biogas, and how current waste treatment and methane production strategies could be improved.},

Anaerobic granular sludge, a biofilm, is a specialized microenvironment where syntrophic bacterial and archaeal organisms grow together in close proximity. Exoelectrogenic bacteria degrading organic substrates or intermediates need an electron sink and electrotrophic meth- anogens represent perfect partners to assimilate those electrons and produce methane.

	abstract = {The thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) of sewage sludge has often been found to be less stable than mesophilic treatment. In comparison to mesophilic digesters, thermophilic reactors treating sludge are generally characterized by relatively high concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the effluent along with poor effluent quality, indicating a lower level of process stability. However, reviewing the literature related to the procedure for obtaining a thermophilic inoculum, it seems that most of the problems associated with the instability and the accumulation of organic intermediates are the result of the manner in which the thermophilic sludge has been obtained. In this paper, the different options available for obtaining an anaerobic digester operating at thermophilic temperature (55°C) have been reviewed. In this light, rapid heating to the target temperature followed by the development of thermophilic microorganisms, which can be determined by VFA dropping to ≤500mg acetic acid L-1 before increasing the organic loading rate (OLR), has been determined the most suitable means of establishing TAD. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the methods reported to enhance each step involved in anaerobic digestion. More important, enzymes are the key to anaerobic digestion, and the strategies for improving enzyme activity are summarized.

Nanowire networks confer conductivity to Geobacter biofilms converting organic compounds to electricity in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and increasing nanowire production is the only genetic manipulation shown to yield strains with improved current-producing capabilities.

Based on the optimal dose of 15 g AC per working volume derived from the 1 L digester, for the same AC dosage in the 8 L digester, an improved operation stability coupled with a higher methane yield was achieved even when digesters without AC supplementation failed after 59 days due to accumulation of substantial organic intermediates.

This study proposed a strategy to accelerate phenol degradation and mitigate its inhibition on the bioprocess by adding conductive materials (CMs) into the anaerobic degradation system. The results showed that CMs could stimulate phenol degradation up to one–fold higher than that in control group. Certain extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) compounds that can act as electron shuttles, i.e. protein and humic substances, were greatly enriched with the existence of CMs. In particular, compared with control group, CMs supplemented groups had 2.3 and 10 to 20 folds low molecular weight protein in bound and soluble EPS, respectively. Carbon nanotube supplemented group exhibited 3 times higher humic substance in soluble EPS. The overall electron transport system activity in CMs groups was much higher than that in control groups. The addition of CMs enriched phenol degradation bacteria–Syntrophorhabdus, Brooklawnia, Treponema and Syntrophus, as well as electroactive methanogens–Methanosaeta. It is proposed that Syntrophus and Methanosaeta were the functional genera in methanogenic phenol degradation via extracellular electron transfer.

Compared to control samples, the GAC supplementation increased the total amount of methane production and its production rate by 31\% and 72\%, respectively. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed a shift in the archaeal community composition; the Methanosarcina proportion decreased 17\%, while the Methanosaeta proportion increased 5.6\%. Metagenomic analyses based on shotgun sequencing demonstrated that the abundance of pilA and omcS genes belonging to Geobacter species decreased 69.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively. Furthermore, the analyses suggested a carbon dioxide reduction pathway rather than an acetate decarboxylation pathway for methane formation. Taken together, these results suggest that GAC improved methane production performance by shifting the microbial community and altering functional genes associated with direct interspecies electron transfer via conductive materials.},

Four laboratory scale reactors, R1, R2, R3 and R4, were set up with different proportions of waste poultry litter, cow dung and poultry droppings and had a 6\% total solid concentration. Digestion was carried out for 50 days at room temperature, 32 ± 3 • C. Volatile solid degradation and specific gas production in the four reactors was 46\%, 51.99\%, 51.96\%, 43\% and 0.263, 0.469, 0.419, 0.221 l/g, respectively, based on the volatile solid (VS) feed. The methane yields were 71\%, 72.5\%, 72.6\% and 70\%, respectively. The COD reductions were 46.1\%, 50.76\%, 48.23\% and 45.12\%, respectively. A kinetic analysis showed that the anaerobic digestion of poultry litter with a co-substrate followed first order kinetics. Among the experimental reactors, R2 (25\% cow dung, 75\% poultry litter) gave the optimum results: a VS reduction of 51.99\%, a specific gas yield of 0.469 l/g and a methane yield of 72.5\%.},

	abstract = {An environmentally acceptable disposal of sewage sludge and agro-wastes presents an urgent problem facing many countries. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a robust and suitable technique for producing renewable energy from wastes. This study aims to improve methane production from anaerobic co-digestion of primary sludge (PS) and wheat straw (WS) depending on their volatile solids (VS) organic load and by adding a proposed waste material of buckwheat husk (BH) based on their carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio. Mesophilic anaerobic batch tests were carried out in 500-mL digesters. Individual and six mixtures of PS and WS at different VS organic loads were anaerobically digested to optimize VS load for the greatest gas production. The highest cumulative methane yield (CMYs) occurred with combined substrates at a VS load of 7.50 gVS/L. In general, the optimized organic loads that gave the highest cumulative biogas yield (CBYs) and CMYs were in the range of 6-8 gVS/L. In addition, AD of individual substrates of PS, WS, and BH and of their mixture at different C/N ratios was investigated regarding to the methane yields. Multi-component substrates produced the greatest CMY at a C/N ratio of 10.07. The CMYs was increased by 39.26\% when the proposed waste material of buckwheat husk (BH) was added to the different mixtures of PS and WS compared to the co-digestion of PS and WS. Experimental results were approved using statistical analysis by ANOVA test at P-value less than 0.05. Purification of methane and biodegradation of VS were evaluated. The results emphasized positive synergy of anaerobic co-digestion for improving CMY and best feedstock utilization.},

In the first stage H 2 fermentation process using untreated RS with raw SS, we obtained a high H 2 yield (21 ml/g-VS) and stable H 2 content (60.9\%). Direct utilization of post-H 2 fermentation residues readily produced biogas, and significantly enhanced the CH 4 yield (266 ml/g-VS) with stable CH 4 content (75-80\%) during the second stage CH 4 fermentation process. Overall, volatile solids removal (60.4\%) and total bioenergy yield (8804 J/g-VS) for the two-stage system were 37.9\% and 59.6\% higher, respectively, than the one-stage system. The efficient production of bioenergy is believed to be due to a synergistically improved second stage process exploiting the well-digested post-H 2 generation residues over the one-stage system.

Most agricultural biomass contains lignocellulose which requires pretreatment prior to AD. For optimization, the pretreatment methods need to be specific to the characteristics of the biomass feedstock. In this review, cereal residue, fruit and vegetable wastes, grasses and animal manure were selected as the agricultural biomass candidates, and the fundamentals and current state of various pretreatment methods used for AD of these feedstocks were investigated. Several nonconventional methods (electrical, ionic liquid-based chemicals, ruminant biological pretreatment) offer potential as targeted pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass, but each comes with its own challenges. Pursuing an energy-intensive route, a combined bioethanol-biogas production could be a promising a second biofuel refinery option, further emphasizing the importance of pretreatment when lignocellulosic feedstock is used.},

Results showed that 10 g/L of hardwood biochar led to 2-fold increment in methane yield (223 L/kg VS) compared to the control (110 L/kg VS). However, increasing the concentration of hardwood biochar did not help in significant increase in methane yield and raised pH and alkalinity up to 8.3 and 24.3 g/L respectively. Principal component analysis showed that methane yield is positively correlated with volatile solid reduction while biochar loading is directly correlated with pH as well as alkalinity and inversely correlated with total volatile fatty acid.

However, some industrial discharges contain a large amount of non-biodegradable organic matter, which cannot be treated properly in a conventional biological WWTP. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and biodegradability of the wastewater organic matter contained in the industrial discharges and to examine the fate of the industrial discharges in a biologicalWWTP. In contrast to most previous studies targeting a specific group of organic compounds or traditional water quality indices, such as biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), this study was purposed to quantify and characterize the biodegradable and nonbiodegradable fractions of the wastewater organic matter. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) fractionation tests and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the industrial discharge from dyeing or pulp mill factories contained more non-biodegradable soluble organic matter than did the domestic wastewater. Statistical analysis on the WWTPs' monitoring data indicated that the industrial discharge containing non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was not treated effectively in a biological WWTP, but was escaping from the system. Thus, industrial discharge that contained non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was a major factor in the decrease in biodegradability of the discharge, affecting the ultimate fate of wastewater organic matter in a biological WWTP. Further application of COD fractionation and fluorescence spectroscopy to wastewaters, with various industrial discharges, will help scientists and engineers to better design and operate a biological WWTP, by understanding the fate of wastewater organic matter.},

	abstract = {Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests are routinely conducted in academia and industry to determine the methane potential of a given substrate. Although many guidelines have been proposed to standardize BMP tests, results published in the peer-reviewed literature show that critical flaws in experimental design or execution are still common. Therefore, a powerful but simple method for evaluating the quality of BMP measurements is proposed in this work: the specific methane production (SMP) curve from any BMP trial should have a similar shape for most substrates, and significant deviation from this typical response is usually associated with a lack of reliability in resulting BMP estimates. In this study, some common experimental mistakes were reproduced to demonstrate this concept and establish relationships between flaws in experiments, SMP curves, and BMP values. The studied flaws were inoculum storage (2 weeks and at different temperatures), inoculum dilution with water (no dilution to 1:2 dilution), and inoculum-to-substrate ratio (from 2.00 to 0.05). Common kinetic models were used to better assess SMP curves. All flaws exhibited an impact on the SMP curves, but excessive dilution and extremely low inoculum-to-substrate ratio had the largest impacts on both SMP curves and BMP. In the most extreme case (ISR of 0.05), there was a clear lag phase of more than 10 days, and the resulting BMP was 15\% lower than for the reference case. Together these results demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. The ultimate goal of this research is to help less experienced researchers identify and address problems in their experimental procedure, ultimately contributing to more accurate BMP measurements. The general approach is both simple and useful, and should always be part of a quality check for BMP tests.},

The results showed that AD of YW with high solid contents easily caused difficulties in the initiation stage due to accumulation of volatile fatty acids. Even with the aid of alkali to successfully initiate the initiation stage, the AD of YW with the high solid content of 29\% generated such a low biogas yield as 207 mL/g VS. By contrast, co-digestion of YW and FW with pH adjustment gave the highest biogas and methane yields of 306 and 180 mL/g VS, 47.8 and 40.3\% higher than those for AD of YW alone, respectively. A sufficiently long acidogenesis duration was helpful for biogas production, while the inhibitions from excessively high ammonia nitrogen concentrations and organic loading rates were apt to happen after extremely long acidogenesis durations.

The effect on biogas yield of the partial substitution of energy crops with agro-waste was also investigated. For each substrate used during the continuous trials, BMP batch assays were also carried out to verify the maximum methane yield theoretically obtainable. Continuous operation results indicated that the co-digestion of manures, energy crops and agro-waste was viable at all operating conditions tested, with the greatest specific gas production of 0.54m3/kgVSfed at an organic load rate of 2kgTVS/m3rd consisting of 50\% manure, 25\% energy crops and 25\% agro-waste on VS basis. No significant differences were observed between high and low loaded reactors suggesting the possibility of either improving the OLR in existing anaerobic reactors or reducing the design volumes of new reactors. © 2012.},

Biogas development can be integrated with strategies to improve sanitation as well as reduce indoor air pollution and greenhouse gases. Currently, the total biogas production in India is 2.07 billion m3/year. This is quite low compared to its potential, which is estimated to be in the range of 29–48 billion m3/year. Hence, this study aims to identify both technical and non-technological barriers impending biogas dissemination in India. Biogas dissemination is affected by various waste, renewable energy, and urban policies. Barriers were therefore identified individually for rural and urban biogas systems existing in India using decomposition analysis. The results show that type and importance of barriers vary strongly between biogas systems due to the difference in technology maturity, feedstock availability and quality, supply chain, awareness level and policy support.},

This review provides a summary of the processes underlying anaerobic digestion, commonly-utilized measurements of anaerobic sludge, operating parameters of anaerobic digesters, and methods of acceleration and optimization used to improve process efficiency. Recent developments in addition to older research are considered to provide a general but comprehensive summary of accumulated knowledge in the theory of anaerobic digestion, as well as considerations in the efficient operation of digesters.

	abstract = {The wet organic fraction of household wastes was digested anaerobically at 37°C and 55°C. At both temperatures the volatile solids loading was increased from 1 g l-1 day-1 to 9.65 g l-1 day-1, by reducing the nominal hydraulic retention time from 93 days to 19 days. The volatile solids removal in the reactors at both temperatures for the same loading rates was in a similar range and was still 65\% at 19 days hydraulic retention time. Although more biogas was produced in the thermophilic reactor, the: energy conservation in methane was slightly lower, because of a lower methane content, compared to the biogas of the mesophilic reactor. The slightly lower amount of energy conserved in the methane of the thermophilic digester was presumably balanced by the hydrogen that escaped into the gas phase and thus was no longer available for methanogenesis. In the thermophilic process, 1.4 g/l ammonia was released, whereas in the mesophilic process only 1 g/l ammonia was generated, presumably from protein degradation. Inhibition studies of methane production and glucose fermentation revealed a K(i) (50\%) of 3 g/l and 3.7 g/l ammonia (equivalent to 0.22 g/l and 0.28 g/l free NH3) at 37°C and a k(i) (50\%) of 3.5 g/l and 3.4 g/l ammonia (equivalent to 0.69 g/l and 0.68 g/l free NH3) at 55°C. This indicated that the thermophilic flora tolerated at least twice as much of free NH3 than the mesophilic flora and, furthermore, that the thermophilic flora was able to degrade more protein. The apparent ammonia concentrations in tie mesophilic and in the thermophilic biowaste reactor were low enough not to inhibit glucose fermentation and methane production of either process significantly, but may have been high enough to inhibit protein degradation. The data indicated either that the mesophilic and thermophilic protein degraders revealed a different sensitivity towards free ammonia or that the mesophilic population contained less versatile protein degraders, leaving more protein undegraded.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) treatment of agricultural and animal waste can be considered as a means of enabling environmental remediation. This research investigated two conditions of anaerobic co-digestion of maize waste and cow dung. This was done by placing a mixture of cow dung and maize waste together in a floating drum digester that was run at two different cow dung/maize ratios of 10:1 and 10:5. Batch conditions were on a bench-scale of AD, 5 L in ? volume, developed to operate under mesophilic (36 6 1 C). Results showed that biogas and methane yields from mes- ophilic digestion at the ratio of 10:1 were lower than yields obtained at ratio tested in the second run (10:5). Biogas yields were 250 and 480 L/kg VS for first and second runs, respectively. In the case of methane, these amounts were pre- sented at 130 and 300 L/kg VS. Furthermore, the average methane content of biogas was calculated as 51 and 62\%, in first and second runs respectively. The total biogas produc- tion of the reactor increased by 92\% when substrates were fed in second condition ratio compared to biogas production during the first condition ratio. In continue the effect ofadd- ing maize waste on biogas yield from cow dung was eval- uated in batch digesters under mesophilic conditions. The addition of maize waste to cow dung presents a viable method to improve biogas yield, as well as a means to use maize waste.},

Co-digestion of DM, CM and WS performed better in methane potential than individual digestion. A larger synergetic effect in co-digestion of DM, CM and WS was found than in mixtures of single manures with WS. As the C/N ratio increased, methane potential initially increased and then declined. C/N ratios of 25:1 and 30:1 had better digestion performance with stable pH and low concentrations of total ammonium nitrogen and free NH3. Maximum methane potential was achieved with DM/CM of 40.3:59.7 and a C/N ratio of 27.2:1 after optimization using response surface methodology.

	abstract = {Global annual production of lignocellulosic biomass including undervalued agricultural residues and greenhouse biomass is about 181.5 billion tonnes. This undervalued biomass has a high potential to produce biogas in anaerobic digestion (AD). Among the various pre-treatment methods, hydrothermal (HT) pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising approach to increase biogas production in AD. However, the high carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of lignocellulosic biomass is reported to be the major limiting factor for a higher biogas yield. Hence, the synergistic integration of low C/N ratio biomass with high C/N ratio lignocellulosic biomass in an AD system appears to be a logical option to enhance biogas yield. High moisture lignocellulosic biomass HT pretreatment and biogas production in AD have the potential for renewable energy production with limited use of process energy. However, hydrothermal process temperature, AD substrate C/N ratio and its inhibitory elements are important parameters for optimum biogas production. Greenhouse biomass pretreatment in hydrothermal process can produce biochar, biogas and biofertilizer, which can be used as input heat and nutrient source for greenhouses. Finally, the operation of greenhouse in this system can manage zero waste and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change.},

AD technology is the biochemical process of biogas production which can change the complex organic materials into a clean and renewable source of energy. AcoD process is a reliable alternative option to resolve the disadvantages of single substrate digestion system related to substrate characteristics and system optimization. This paper reviewed the research progress and challenges of AcoD technology, and the contribution of different techniques in biogas production engineering. As the applicability and demand of the AcoD technology increases, the complexity of the system becomes increased, and the characterization of organic materials becomes volatile which requires advanced methods for investigation. Numerous publications have been noted that ADM1 model and its modified version becomes the most powerful tool to optimize the AcoD process of biogas production, and indicating that the disintegration and hydrolysis steps are the limiting factors of co-digestion process. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) test is promising method to determine the biodegradability and decomposition rate of organic materials. The addition of different environmentally friendly nanoparticles can improve the stability and performance of the AcoD system. The process optimization and improvement of biogas production still seek further investigations. Furthermore, using advanced simulation approaches and characterization methods of organic wastes can accelerate the transformation to industrializations, and realize the significant improvement of biogas production as a renewable source and economically feasible energy in developing countries, like China.

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic materials such as agricultural plant residues are widely available in large amounts and can be used for production of biogas without the risk of competition for arable land. However, the intricate structure of lignocellulose, a major component of the plant cell wall, limits microbial degradation and consequently results in low degradation rate and low biogas yield. The aim of this thesis was to investigate microbial communities engaged in the degradation of lignocellulose and search for correlations with process operating parameters and degradation efficiency. Such information could be used in a long-term perspective for management of biogas processes towards more efficient degradation. The bacterial and archaeal communities as well as functional gene communities of glycoside hydrolase family 5 (cel5) and 48 (cel48), representing potential cellulose- degrading bacteria, were investigated in laboratory-scale and industrial-scale digesters; and their incidence was related to process parameters. The laboratory-scale digesters were operated with manure, alone or in co-digestion with wheat straw (mechanically chopped or treated with steam explosion), at different temperatures. The results demonstrated that all digesters had similar overall process performance, e.g. degree of degradation and biogas yield, irrespective of straw addition or changes in temperature. However, the microbial communities, including potential cellulose-degrading bacteria, changed in response to the changes in operation, e.g. addition of straw, pre-treatment and operating temperature. In a survey of degradation efficiency of cellulose and wheat straw in 10 industrial-scale biogas plants in Sweden, free ammonia level was identified as a potential factor affecting degradation efficiency as well as the species richness and taxonomic composition of bacterial communities, including the cel5 community.},

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant natural resource with high biomethane potential. However, complex structure of lignocellulosic biomass has hampered the efficient utilization of this bioresource. Previous studies have investigated the overall anaerobic digestion performance of lignocellulosic biomass, but the individual participation of each lignocellulosic component during anaerobic digestion remained unclear. Thus, this study investigated the methane production characteristics of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and their mixtures along with the microbial communities involved in anaerobic digestion. The results showed that the biomethane potential of cellulose was higher than that of hemicellulose; however, hemicellulose was hydrolysed more quickly than cellulose, while lignin was very difficult to be digested. The higher concentrations of acetic, n-butyric and n-valeric acids hydrolysed from the hemicellulose resulted in a lower pH and more severe inhibition on methane production than that of cellulose, and the methanogenesis gradually recovered after pH adjustment. The co-digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose increased the methane yield and biodegradability compared to mono-digestions. The addition of lignin to cellulose brought more significant decrease in the methane yield of cellulose than that of hemicellulose. Substrate-related bacteria such as Clostridium sensu stricto, Lutaonella, Cloacibacillus and Christensenella showed higher relative abundance in cellulose digestate, and sugar-fermenting bacteria such as Saccharofermentans, Petrimonas and Levilinea were more rich in the digestate of hemicellulose. Moreover, methanogenic Methanospirillum and Methanothrix likely contributed to the methane production of cellulose, while aciduric methanogens from Methanobrevibacter, Methanomassiliicoccus, Methanobacterium and Methanoculleus contributed to that of hemicellulose. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass during anaerobic digestion.},

	abstract = {The world is now seeking sources of renewable energy that are both economical and environmentally friendly. Purified biogas is one essential source of renewable energy that can act as a substitute for fossil fuels. Anaerobic digestion has been recognised as a biochemical method of biogas generation that can convert organic compounds into a sustainable source of energy. Anaerobic co-digestion, AcoD is considered a pragmatic method to resolve the difficulties related to substrate properties and system optimisation in single-substrate digestion processes. The present manuscript studied the research prospects and challenges of anaerobic co-digestion, and the contributions of different methods in biogas generation studies. With the increased use of anaerobic co-digestion, the complexity of the process also increases. Several mathematical models had been established to optimise the anaerobic co-digestion technique. The biological methane potential test is a preferred technique for measuring the biodegradability and decomposition rate of organic substances. Furthermore, various additives are now used to maximise methane production. The improvement and optimisation processes of biogas production still need to be investigated in greater detail. In developing countries like Malaysia, biogas production may be more economically feasible if the latest simulation and characterisation methods are used at the industrial scale. Finally, this review describes a design and development framework to incorporate various aspects to enhance biogas production.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an effective biological treatment for stabilizing organic compounds in waste/wastewater and in simultaneously producing biogas. However, it is often limited by the slow reaction rates of different microorganisms' syntrophic biological metabolisms. Stable and fast interspecies electron transfer (IET) between volatile fatty acid-oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens is crucial for efficient methanogenesis. In this syntrophic interaction, electrons are exchanged via redox mediators such as hydrogen and formate. Recently, direct IET (DIET) has been revealed as an important IET route for AD. Microorganisms undergoing DIET form interspecies electrical connections via membrane-associated cytochromes and conductive pili; thus, redox mediators are not required for electron exchange. This indicates that DIET is more thermodynamically favorable than indirect IET. Recent studies have shown that conductive materials (e.g., iron oxides, activated carbon, biochar, and carbon fibers) can mediate direct electrical connections for DIET. Microorganisms attach to conductive materials' surfaces or vice versa according to particle size, and form conductive biofilms or aggregates. Different conductive materials promote DIET and improve AD performance in digesters treating different feedstocks, potentially suggesting a new approach to enhancing AD performance. This review discusses the role and potential of DIET in methanogenic systems, especially with conductive materials for promoting DIET.},

The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test is one of the most important tests for evaluating the biodegradability and methane production capacity of any organic waste. Previous research confirms that the addition of conductive materials significantly enhances the methane production yield. This study concludes that the addition of granular activated carbon (GAC) increases methane yield by 34\% in the first instance. Furthermore, results show that methane production is increased by 54\% when a GAC biofilm is developed 10 days before undertaking the BMP test. In addition, the electroactive population was 30\% higher when attached to the GAC than in control reactors. Moreover, results show that electroactive communities attached to the GAC increased by 38\% when a GAC biofilm is developed 10 days before undertaking the BMP test, additionally only in these reactors Geobacter was identified. GAC has two main effects in anaerobic digestion; it promotes direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) by developing an electro-active biofilm and simultaneously it reduces redox potential from -223 mV to -470 mV. These results suggest that the addition of GAC to biodigesters, improves the anaerobic digestion performance in industrial processed food waste.},

	abstract = {Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) in microbial communities plays a significant role in improving efficiency of biomethane production from anaerobic digestion. In this study, the impacts of conductive graphene on mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD and TAD) were comparatively assessed using the model substrate ethanol. The maximum electron transfer flux for graphene-based DIET was calculated at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures (35 °C and 55 °C). Biomethane potential results showed that the addition of graphene (1.0 g/L) significantly enhanced biomethane production rates by 25.0\% in MAD and 26.4\% in TAD. The increased biomethane production was accompanied with enhanced ethanol degradation. The theoretical calculations showed that graphene-based DIET fluxes in MAD (76.4 mA) and TAD (75.1 mA) were at the same level, which suggests temperature might not be a significant factor affecting DIET. This slight difference was ascribed to the different Gibbs free energy changes of the overall DIET reaction (CH3CH2OH + 1/2CO2 → 1/2CH4 + CH3COO− + 5H+) in MAD and TAD. Microbial analysis revealed that the dominant microbes in response to graphene addition were distinctly different between MAD and TAD. The results indicated that the bacteria of Levilinea dominated in MAD, while Coprothermobacter dominated in TAD. The abundance of archaeal Methanobacterium decreased, while Methanosaeta increased with increasing temperature.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion is a versatile biotechnology for conversion of organic wastes to valuable biogas. Anaerobic digestion of manure is making the most of it, as the process allows simultaneous bio-energy generation, production of nutrient rich soil amendment, reduced emission of greenhouse gases and odor control; it is thus in line with climate friendly farming practices. Despite the enumerated advantages, the potential of manure for biogas production is not fully utilized due to the low and imbalance carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio in animal manures. To satisfy the anaerobic digestion requirements and to compensate the carbon deficiency of manure, there should be another carbon-rich substrate to be co-digested with manure to improve its characteristics for anaerobic digestion; lignocellulosic biomass residues seem promising for this purpose. This work presents a review on anaerobic co-digestion of animal manure and lignocellulosic feedstock for biogas production. Several research studies conducted on co-digestion of these organic wastes are described and reviewed. The impact of numerous parameters including temperature, pH, organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), C/N ratio, alkalinity and concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) on the performance and stability of the co-digestion process is extensively discussed. The influence of various pretreatment methods including physical, chemical and biological pretreatments on providing well-prepared substrate for anaerobic co-digestion and thus enhancement of biogas production is discussed. An overview of the most significant factors and intermediates which can inhibit or even cease the process is also presented.},

	abstract = {Biomass based energy generation is one of the major focus areas of renewable energy programs in India. The strength of India's biomass resources mostly lies in the agricultural sector. A large quantity of crop residue biomass is generated in India. However, crop residue biomasses are distributed resources with variation in spatio-temporal availability and its characteristics. Competing uses of residues also vary geographically. Therefore, local biomass databases are important for decentralized bioenergy programs. However, in India, state wise crop level biomass database is limited. The present paper assessed crop residue biomass and subsequently bioenergy potential in all the 28 states of India using crop statistics and standard procedure. A total of 39 residues from 26 crops cultivated in India are considered for the study. Overall, India produces 686 MT gross crop residue biomass on annual basis, of which 234 MT (34\% of gross) are estimated as surplus for bioenergy generation. At state level, Uttar Pradesh produces the highest amount of crop residue amongst all the 28 states. Amongst all the crops, sugarcane produces the highest amount of surplus residue followed by rice. The estimated annual bioenergy potential from the surplus crop residue biomass is 4.15 EJ, equivalent to 17\% of India's total primary energy consumption. There exists variation from 679 MJ (West Bengal) to 16,840 MJ (Punjab) of per capita crop residue bioenergy potential amongst the states of India. The information generated in this study is expected to be useful for decentralized crop residue based energy planning by the states of India which in turn would positively influence the overall renewable energy growth in India. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	doi = {10.1039/c8ew00447a},
	abstract = {Amending anaerobic digesters with pyrogenic carbonaceous materials (PCMs) has been suggested to improve methane (CH 4 ) production by enabling electron conduction between fermenters and methanogens. This enhancement has been attributed to the electrical conductivity of some PCMs. Properties other than conductivity have received little attention, leaving uncertain the primary drivers of the observed improvements. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to relate the electrical conductivity, adsorptive behavior, pH effects, and surface properties of PCMs to CH 4 production rates and CH 4 recoveries in swine wastewater-fed, short-term anaerobic batch reactors. Three types of PCM particles [graphite, biochar, and activated carbon (AC)] in two size ranges and three particle loadings were tested and compared to non-conductive glass particles and no-particle controls. Graphite amendments resulted in higher CH 4 production rates and CH 4 recoveries than the no-particle controls and showed improvements with increased particle loadings. The impact of biochar and AC amendments depended on particle sizes and loadings, with granule amendments generally exceeding or matching the controls. Powdered biochar and AC amendments substantially decreased the performance. Material conductivity was a poor predictor of CH 4 production rates, and bulk solution pH changes due to particle amendments could not explain reactor performance discrepancies. Adsorption was a critical material property controlling the fate of wastewater chemical oxygen demand (COD). Powdered biochar and AC, which adsorbed more COD than graphite and glass, resulted in lower COD to CH 4 conversion. These results indicate that PCM properties other than conductivity, such as adsorption, can strongly impact short-term bioreactor performance. These properties should be taken into consideration when selecting and optimizing PCMs for biological-based technologies.},

	abstract = {Conductive materials have been widely investigated to accelerate and stabilize the conversion of organic wastes to methane. However, the potential mechanisms involved with different types of conductive materials are still unclear. In this study, magnetite (Fe3O4) and granular activated carbon (GAC), as the two typical conductive materials, were respectively supplemented to acidogenesis and methanogenesis of a two-phase anaerobic digestion (AD) system in an attempt to explore their different mechanisms. The results showed that, magnetite supplemented to the acidogenic phase could enhance the decomposition of complex organics into simples, but significantly raise the hydrogen partial pressure as well as enrich the hydrogen-utilizing methanogens, which were not expected for aceticlastic methanogenesis known as a mainstream of methanogenesis in most of traditional digesters. GAC supplemented to the methanogenic phase had less influences on syntrophic metabolism of alcohols and fatty acids when acidogenesis was ineffective or out of work. Microbial community analysis suggested that direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) had been established on the GAC, though the insignificant improvement of performances. Once magnetite was supplemented to the acidogenesis to improve the acidification efficiency, the syntrophic conversion of alcohols and fatty acids to methane in the GAC-supplemented methanogenic phase was significantly improved. These results suggested that, DIET was unlikely to participate in the direct decomposition of complex organics, even in the presence of GAC, but it could work effectively once acidogenesis functioned well.},

Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) has recently been recognized as an alternative route to hydrogen interspecies transfer as a mechanism for interspecies syntrophic electron exchange. Therefore, the possibility of accelerating syntrophic metabolism of ethanol in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors by incorporating conductive materials in reactor design was investigated. Graphite, biochar, and carbon cloth all immediately enhanced methane production and COD removal. As the hydraulic retention time was decreased the increased effectiveness of treatment in reactors with conductive materials increased versus the control reactor. When these conductive materials were removed from the reactors rates of syntrophic metabolism declined to rates comparable to the control reactor. These results suggest that incorporating conductive materials in the design of UASB reactors may enhance digester effectiveness.},

The occurrence of direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) in microbial communities, as an alternative or complementary to indirect electron transfer (via hydrogen or formate), is the main explanation given to justify the improvement of methane production. Not disregarding that DIET can be promoted in the presence of certain CM, it surely does not explain all the reported observations. In fact, in methanogenic environments DIET was only unequivocally demonstrated in cocultures of Geobacter metallireducens with Methanosaeta harundinacea or Methanosarcina barkeri and frequently Geobacter sp. are not detected in improved methane production driven systems. Furthermore, conductive carbon nanotubes were shown to accelerate the activity of methanogens growing in pure cultures, where DIET is not expected to occur, and hydrogenotrophic activity is ubiquitous in full-scale anaerobic digesters treating for example brewery wastewaters, indicating that interspecies hydrogen transfer is an important electron transfer mechanism in those systems. This paper presents an overview of the effect of several iron-based and carbon-based CM in bioengineered systems, focusing on the improvement in methane production and in microbial communities' changes.

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion is an attractive waste treatment practice in which both pollution control and energy recovery can be achieved. Many agricultural and industrial wastes are ideal candidates for anaerobic digestion because they contain high levels of easily biodegradable materials. Problems such as low methane yield and process instability are often encountered in anaerobic digestion, preventing this technique from being widely applied. A wide variety of inhibitory substances are the primary cause of anaerobic digester upset or failure since they are present in substantial concentrations in wastes. Considerable research efforts have been made to identify the mechanism and the controlling factors of inhibition. This review provides a detailed summary of the research conducted on the inhibition of anaerobic processes. The inhibitors commonly present in anaerobic digesters include ammonia, sulfide, light metal ions, heavy metals, and organics. Due to the difference in anaerobic inocula, waste composition, and experimental methods and conditions, literature results on inhibition caused by specific toxicants vary widely. Co-digestion with other waste, adaptation of microorganisms to inhibitory substances, and incorporation of methods to remove or counteract toxicants before anaerobic digestion can significantly improve the waste treatment efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, harder-to-reach fossil fuels require more energy to extract and, hence, are coming at an increasing ‘energy cost’. Associated declines in fossil fuel energy-return-on-investment ratios at first appear of little concern, given that published estimates for oil, coal and gas are typically above 25:1. However, such ratios are measured at the primary energy stage and should instead be estimated at the final stage where energy enters the economy (for example, electricity and petrol). Here, we calculate global time series (1995–2011) energy-return-on-investment ratios for fossil fuels at both primary and final energy stages. We concur with common primary-stage estimates ({\textasciitilde}30:1), but find very low ratios at the final stage: around 6:1 and declining. This implies that fossil fuel energy-return-on-investment ratios may be much closer to those of renewables than previously expected and that they could decline precipitously in the near future.},

There is a large amount of literature available on optimization of anaerobic digestion; however, given the continued development and implementation of innovative technologies, together with the introduction of increasingly complex systems, it is necessary to update present knowledge on process parameters and their role on operational ranges and flexibilities in real-life anaerobic digestion system. Accordingly, the present review discusses the importance of the selection of operational parameters in existing technologies and their impact on biogas yield. Notably, the four broad areas of feedstock utilization (substrate, inoculum, codigestion and pretreatment), process condition (pH, temperature, pressure, and reactor design), reactor control (HRT and OLR) and inhibition (Ammonia and VFAs) are covered in this review. In addition, particular emphasis is placed on the most recent innovations that have been or may be implemented in current or future biogas plants.},

	abstract = {Rising global energy needs and limited fossil fuel reserves have led to increased use of renewable energies. In Germany, this has entailed massive exploitation of agricultural biomass for biogas generation, associated with unsustainable farming practices. Organic agriculture not only reduces negative environmental impacts, organic farmers were also prime movers in anaerobic digestion (AD) in Germany. This study's aim was to identify the structure, development, and characteristics of biogas production associated with organic farming systems in order to estimate further development, as well as energetic and associated agronomic potentials. Surveys were conducted among organic farms with AD technology. 144 biogas plants could be included in the analysis. Total installed electrical capacity was 30.8 MW{\textless}inf{\textgreater}el{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, accounting for only 0.8\% of the total installed electrical capacity in the German biogas sector. Recently, larger plant types ({\textgreater}250 kW{\textless}inf{\textgreater}el{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) with increased use of (also purchased) energy crops have emerged. Farmers noticed increases in yields (22\% on average) and quality of cash crops in arable farming through integrated biogas production. In conclusion, although the share of AD in organic farming is relatively small it can provide various complementary socio-ecological benefits such as the enhancement of food output through digestate fertilization without additional need for land, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock manures and soils. However, to achieve this eco-functional intensification, AD systems and their management have to be well adapted to farm size and production focus and based primarily on residue biomass.},

However, results from this study indicate that the AD system is not fully optimized in combination with farming practices regarding sustainability. Therefore, the Industrial Symbiosis concept, combined with energy and environmental system analysis, Life Cycle Analysis and modeling is used to optimize a farm-scale AD system on four indicators of sustainability (i.e., energy efficiency, carbon footprint, environmental impacts and costs). Implemented in a theoretical case, where a cooperation of farms share biomass feedstocks, a symbiotic AD system can significantly lower external energy consumption by 72 to 92\%, carbon footprint by 71 to 91\%, environmental impacts by 68 to 89\%, and yearly expenditures by 56 to 66\% compared to a reference cooperation. The largest reductions and economic gains can be achieved when a surplus of manure is available for upgrading into organic fertilizer to replace fossil fertilizers. Applying the aforementioned symbiotic concept to the Dutch farming sector can help to achieve the stated goals indicated by the Dutch agricultural sector for the year 2020.},

	abstract = {Fuel cell is an efficient energy conversion device converting chemical energy directly into electrical energy. It is a fact that, to boost the fuel cell performance, resistance (charge transfer resistance, mass transfer resistance and electrolyte resistance) should be decreased. For this, many techniques have been used for cell testing such as: cyclic voltammetry, current interruption measurement, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Among these techniques, EIS is a well-established, non-intrusive, non-destructive, semi-quantitative, and an efficient technique for identification of each circuit element. In this review article, application of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in identification of individual components of total resistance and their dependence on different factors in biofuel cell along with some recent advancement in this technique have been discussed.},

Given the great diversity in microbial metabolic pathways, a wide variety of processes are possible and have been demonstrated in principle. The generation of electrical currents coupled with the degradation of wastes or the capture of light energy is under extensive investigation. This area has seen the greatest development with an over tenfold increase in power densities in the past decade. A relatively new development is electrosynthesis, the electrically driven fixation of CO2 into various chemicals. Moreover, microbial electrochemical devices can be used to carry out desalination or "unbalanced" chemical conversions. Microbial electrocatalysis has the advantages of the exquisite specificity and regioselectivity of biochemical reactions coupled with the robustness and self-duplicating properties of living systems. Here, recent advances in this area are reviewed with significant achievements highlighted.

Over the years, the growing interests in low carbon energy, wastes valorization and the sustainable bioremediation of environmental pollutants have generated interests in BES such as microbial fuel cells (MFC) and bioelectrochemical fuel cells (BFC). The MFCs are the most advanced BES that can ensure the microbial conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. Therefore, this article seeks to review and present valuable literature on the fundamental operational principles, mechanisms and understanding of BES such as MFCs. It seeks to highlight the schematics of these systems along with the processes and mechanisms such as the oxidation of organic substrates ranging from acetate compounds to complex mixtures. Furthermore, the prospects, challenges, and future applications of BES technologies are presented. The findings indicate that BFCs and MFCs are hampered by low efficiencies, energy output, mass transfer, porosity, and proton conductivity of the electrode and membrane materials along with mechanical strength, scalability, biocompatibility, and chemical stability. However, BES could potentially impact on clean energy production, greenhouse gases mitigation, wastewater treatment, bioanalysis, biosensors, and environmental remediation in the future.},

The reasons behind this new activity are the relatively recent discovery of electrogenic or electroactive bacteria and the vision of two important practical applications, as wastewater treatment coupled with clean energy production and power supply systems for isolated low-power sensor devices. Although some analytical applications of MFCs were proposed earlier (as biochemical oxygen demand sensing) only lately a myriad of new uses of this technology are being presented by research groups around the world, which combine both biological-microbiological and electroanalytical expertises. This is the second part of a review of MFC applications in the area of analytical sciences. In Part I a general introduction to biological-based analytical methods including bioassays, biosensors, MFCs design, operating principles, as well as, perhaps the main and earlier presented application, the use as a BOD sensor was reviewed. In Part II, other proposed uses are presented and discussed. As other microbially based analytical systems, MFCs are satisfactory systems to measure and integrate complex parameters that are difficult or impossible to measure otherwise, such as water toxicity (where the toxic effect to aquatic organisms needed to be integrated). We explore here the methods proposed to measure toxicity, microbial metabolism, and, being of special interest to space exploration, life sensors. Also, some methods with higher specificity, proposed to detect a single analyte, are presented. Different possibilities to increase selectivity and sensitivity, by using molecular biology or other modern techniques are also discussed here. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Microbially-catalyzed cathodes are evolving for new bioprocessing applications for waste(water) treatment, carbon dioxide fixation, chemical product formation, or bioremediation. Extracellular electron transfer processes in biological anodes, were the electrode serves as electron acceptor, have been widely studied. However, for biological cathodes the question remains: what are the biochemical mechanisms for the extracellular electron transfer from a cathode (electron donor) to a microorganism? This question was approached by not only analysing the literature on biocathodes, but also by investigating known extracellular microbial oxidation reactions in environmental processes. Here, it is predicted that in direct electron transfer reactions, c-type cytochromes often together with hydrogenases play a critical role and that, in mediated electron transfer reactions, natural redox mediators, such as PQQ, will be involved in the bioelectrochemical reaction. These mechanisms are very similar to processes at the bioanode, but the components operate at different redox potentials. The biocatalyzed cathode reactions, thereby, are not necessarily energy conserving for the microorganism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The cathode surface area is always important for increasing power. Doubling the cathode size can increase power by 62\% with domestic wastewater, but doubling the anode size increases power by 12\%. Volumetric power density was shown to be a linear function of cathode specific surface area (ratio of cathode surface area to reactor volume), but the impact of cathode size on power generation depended on the substrate strength (COD) and conductivity.

	abstract = {It is clear that the density and porosity of biochar will impact its mobility in the environment, its interaction with the soil hydrologic cycle, and its suitability as an ecological niche for soil microorganisms. However, the wide range of biochar pore sizes complicates biochar porosity characterization, making it challenging to find methods appropriate to connect the fundamental physical properties of density and porosity to environmental outcomes. Here, we report the use of two fast, simple density measurement techniques to characterize biochar density and porosity. We measured biochar skeletal density by helium pycnometry and envelope density by displacement of a dry granular suspension. We found that biochar skeletal density ranged from 1.34gcm -3 to 1.96gcm -3 , and increased with pyrolysis temperature. Biochar envelope density ranged from 0.25gcm -3 to 0.60gcm -3 , and was higher for wood biochars than grass biochars-a difference we attribute to plant cell structures preserved during pyrolysis. We compared the pore volumes measured by pycnometry with those measured by nitrogen gas sorption and mercury porosimetry. We show that biochar pore volumes measured by pycnometry are comparable to the values obtained by mercury porosimetry, the current benchmark method. We also show that the majority of biochar pore volume is in macropores, and thus, is not measured by gas sorption analysis. These fast, simple techniques can now be used to study the relationship between biochar's physical properties and its environmental behaviors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Mechanisms for DIET have primarily been studied in defined cocultures in which Geobacter species are one of the DIET partners. Electrically conductive pili (e-pili) can be an important electrical conduit for DIET. However, there may be instances in which electrical contacts are made between electron transport proteins associated with the outer membranes of the partners. Alternatively, DIET partners can plug into conductive carbon materials, such as granular activated carbon, carbon cloth, and biochar, for long-range electron exchange without the need for e-pili. Magnetite promotes DIET, possibly by acting as a substitute for outer-surface c-type cytochromes. DIET is the primary mode of inter-species electron exchange in some anaerobic digesters converting wastes to methane. Promoting DIET with conductive materials shows promise for stabilizing and accelerating methane production in digesters, permitting higher organic loading rates. Various lines of evidence suggest that DIET is important in terrestrial wetlands, which are an important source of atmospheric methane. DIET may also have a role in anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction, an important control on methane releases. The finding that DIET can serve as the source of electrons for anaerobic photosynthesis further broadens its potential environmental significance. Microorganisms capable of DIET are good catalysts for several bioelectrochemical technologies and e-pili are a promising renewable source of electronic materials. The study of DIET is in its early stages, and additional investigation is required to better understand the diversity of microorganisms that are capable of DIET, the importance of DIET to carbon and electron flow in anaerobic environments, and the biochemistry and physiology of DIET.},

The survey reports the emission rate estimates of the main greenhouse gases (GHG), namely CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O, according to several case studies conducted over the world. Direct emissions of gaseous pollutants are then discussed, with a focus on nitrogen oxides (NO x ); evidences of the importance of suitable biomass and digestate storages are also reported. The current knowledge on the environmental impact induced by final use of digestate is critically discussed, considering both soil fertility and nitrogen release into atmosphere and groundwater; several case studies are reported, showing the importance of NH 3 emissions with regards to secondary aerosol formation. The biogas upgrading to biomethane is also included in the study: with this regard, the methane slip in the off-gas can significantly reduce the environmental benefits.},

	abstract = {It is in the interest of operators of anaerobic digestion plants to maximise methane production whilst concomitantly reducing the chemical oxygen demand of the digested material. Although the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is not a new idea, commercial anaerobic digestion processes are often operated at well below their optimal performance due to a variety of factors. This paper reviews current optimisation techniques associated with anaerobic digestion and suggests possible areas where improvements could be made, including the basic design considerations of a single or multi-stage reactor configuration, the type, power and duration of the mixing regime and the retention of active microbial biomass within the reactor. Optimisation of environmental conditions within the digester such as temperature, pH, buffering capacity and fatty acid concentrations is also discussed. The methane-producing potential of various agriculturally sourced feedstocks has been examined, as has the advantages of co-digestion to improve carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and the use of pre-treatments and additives to improve hydrolysis rates or supplement essential nutrients which may be limiting. However, perhaps the greatest shortfall in biogas production is the lack of reliable sensory equipment to monitor key parameters and suitable, parallelised control systems to ensure that the process continually operates at optimal performance. Modern techniques such as software sensors and powerful, flexible controllers are capable of solving these problems. A direct comparison can be made here with, for instance, oil refineries where a more mature technology uses continuous in situ monitoring and associated feedback procedures to routinely deliver continuous, optimal performance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion has received significant attention in recent years due to dual benefits of waste diversion from landfill and bioenergy recovery. Among various temperature regimes, digesters operated under thermophilic (50–70 °C) condition has potential to provide several advantages over mesophilic (30–45 °C) and psychrophilic ({\textless}20 °C) conditions, which include faster degradation of organics and higher energy recovery. However, the operation of thermophilic digesters requires closer monitoring and control due to an additional risk of ammonia inhibition and irreversible acidification through the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. Conventional strategies to alleviate instabilities in thermophilic anaerobic digestion process have been focused primarily on the development of robust microbiome and co-digestion of complementary substrates. On the other hand, emerging strategies include the integration of digesters with microbial electrochemical systems and amendment of conductive additives. This review provides a critical overview of these strategies and summarizes research gaps to guide researchers and practitioners in the future research.},

Here, the electrical conductivity of the resulting products was studied under moderate compression. The influence of the applied pressure, sample volume, mechanical work, and density of the hybrid materials was thoroughly investigated. The DC electrical conductivity of the compressed samples was measured at room temperature by the four-probe method. Compaction assays suggest that the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites are largely determined by the carbon matrix. Both the decrease in volume and the increase in density were relatively small and only significant at pressures lower than 100 kPa for AC and most nanocomposites. In contrast, the bulk electrical conductivity of the hybrid materials was strongly influenced by the intrinsic conductivity, mean crystallite size, content and chemical nature of the supported phases, which ultimately depend on the metal oxide precursor and heat treatment temperature. The supported nanoparticles may be considered to act as electrical switches either hindering or favouring the effective electron transport between the AC cores of neighbouring composite particles in contact under compression. Conductivity values as a rule were lower for the nanocomposites than for the raw AC, all of them falling in the range of semiconductor materials. With the increase in heat treatment temperature, the trend is toward the improvement of conductivity due to the increase in the crystallite size and, in some cases, to the formation of metals in the elemental state and even metal carbides. The patterns of variation of the electrical conductivity with pressure and mechanical work were slightly similar, thus suggesting the predominance of the pressure effects rather than the volume ones. © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

So far, this interspecies electron transfer has been studied with a special focus on syntrophy and was successfully demonstrated for several couples of species. In this article we argue that electron exchange between microbes exists beyond syntrophy or mutualism and could also promote competitive and even parasitic behaviour. Based on three interesting case studies identified from the literature, we also highlight that such nonmutualistic interactions could be widespread and of particular significance for the survival of pathogens or the shaping of complex microbial communities.},

Furthermore, a function, which described the influence of solids on the process of hydrolysis, has been integrated to reproduce reliable ammonium concentrations. The model was calibrated by using the modified Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient to evaluate simulation quality.

Using this model, a set of parameters, such as the biochemical composition of the waste to be digested, its methane production yield and kinetics, has to be defined for each new substrate. In the recent years, near infrared analyses have been reported as a fast and accurate solution for the estimation of methane production yield and biochemical composition. However, the estimation of methane production kinetics requires time-consuming analysis. Here, a partial least square regression model was developed for a fast and efficient estimation of methane production kinetics using near infrared spectroscopy on 275 bio-waste samples. The development of this characterization reduces the time of analysis from 30 days to a matter of minutes. Then, biochemical composition and methane production yield and kinetics predicted by near infrared spectroscopy were implemented in a modified Anaerobic Digestion Model n°1 in order to simulate the performance of anaerobic digestion processes. This approach was validated using different data sets and was demonstrated to provide a powerful predictive tool for advanced control of anaerobic digestion plants and feeding strategy optimization.},

Characterization of untreated and pretreated biomass was performed by employing scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Maximum increase of 101 and 71\% in released reducing sugars was obtained after 42 days of pretreatment for wheat and pearl millet straw, respectively.

This paper reviews changes in application area, and finds that diversity of use has increased, with application by both specialist and non-specialist users, particularly for systems analysis, and identification of underlying process characteristics. However, the three areas of input/substrate characterisation, physicochemistry modelling, particularly in the plant wide context, and application of multidimensional modelling have been identified as key challenges. A systematic methodology for characterising diverse simple and complex substrates is a major barrier to model application. This has been addressed to a limited extent, focused on domestic streams, but needs to be developed further and generalised. Within physicochemistry, the need is broad, but requirements related specifically to plant wide domestic modelling of phosphorous are identified as relating to solid-liquid interactions and the sulfur cycle. This is critical to future phosphorous control and nutrient recovery. Multidimensional modelling is highly important to all areas of anaerobic process application, but barriers are mainly related to accessibility rather than technical issues, and in particular, broader application to solid phase digestion would be highly beneficial to optimisation of design and operation.},

However, there are two key problems in the practical application, i.e., poor system stability and low reactor efficiency. In this paper, additives used in anaerobic digestion of food waste were systematically reviewed in view of system stability and reactor efficiency. Enzymes showed excellent property in food waste pre-hydrolysis stage with almost all macromolecular matters being rapidly resolved. Fungi fermentation process to produce hydrolytic enzymes, can be regarded as a promising and low-cost way to realize rate-limiting step elimination. It can be also concluded that adding neutralizers, buffer chemicals and some other materials are effective to maintain the pH level for practical application. Trace metals in food waste are not enough but needed for methanogens activation in long term and high loading rate operation. In addition, direct interspecies electron transfer could be much helpful for intermediate refractory organic acids degradation and methanogenesis promotion with additives of conductive materials, which is also discussed and should be studied further in anaerobic digestion of food waste. Based on literature review, a new concept is proposed for further study, suggesting that after being well liquefied with enzyme pre-hydrolysis, food waste could be co-digested with landfill leachate in a high-rate anaerobic reactor stably, resulting in a high bioenergy recovery efficiency.},

DIET-based syntrophy can naturally occur in some anaerobic digester via conductive pili, however, can be engineered via the addition of various non-biological conductive materials. In recent years, research into understanding and engineering DIET-based syntrophy has emerged with the aim of improving methanogenesis kinetics in anaerobic digestion. This article presents a state-of-art review focusing on the fundamental mechanisms, key microbial players, the role of electrical conductivity, the effectiveness of various conductive additives, the significance of substrate characteristics and organic loading rates in promoting DIET in anaerobic digestion.},

	abstract = {Three main lignocellulosic components (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) are major plant cell walls. Their content in biomass crops, for example, MD2 pineapple waste will affect the heating values (HHV) if uses as a feedstock for the solid biofuel (biocoke). The aim of this paper is to identify the amount of lignocellulosic content in the MD2 pineapple waste and its effect on heating value. The experiment and parameters setup were carried out by following the chemical composition determination of standard methods. The process involved the sample preparation and treatment process by using NaOH and sodium chlorite for bleaching purposes. The effect of a percent of the lignocellulosic content in the MD2 pineapple waste before and after bleaching process towards heating value was studied. From the result, lignocellulosic in leaves (Cellulose 30 wt\%, Hemicellulose 37 wt\% and Lignin 22 wt\%) showed the similarities (slightly higher and lower) content compared to the stem (Cellulose 46 wt\%, Hemicellulose 29 wt\% and Lignin 17 wt\%) and root (Cellulose 42 wt\%, Hemicellulose 32 wt\% and Lignin 19 wt\%). The majority of the leaves for the whole non-woody plant will give the cumulative effects since the quantity of stem and root is only about 15 \% of the total weight of the plant. The cellulose and hemicellulose produce different thermal stability due to their different chemical structure even though they are both polysaccharides. From the data, all parts of MD2 pineapple has high cellulose and hemicellulose content. The hemicellulose can indicate the ignition temperature and time to ignite of the biocoke product produce by MD2 pineapple waste same goes to the cellulose content. The decomposition of lignin from start to end of the burning process can be an indicator that the biocoke product produces from MD2 pineapple waste can withstand up until 900 °C or above with some additional reactor or chemical that can enhance its thermal properties. 1.},

	abstract = {Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB), a guild of anoxygenic photomixotrophic organisms, rise interest to capture nutrients from wastewater in mixed-culture bioprocesses. One challenge targets the aggregation of PNSB biomass through gravitational separation from the treated water to facilitate its retention and accumulation, while avoiding the need for membranes. We aimed to produce an enriched, concentrated, well-settling, nutrient-removing PNSB biomass using sequencing batch regimes (SBR) in an anaerobic photobioreactor. The stirred tank was fed with a synthetic influent mimicking loaded municipal wastewater (430-860 mg CODAc LInf - 1, COD:N:P ratio of 100:36:4-100:11:2 m/m/m), operated at 30°C and pH 7, and continuously irradiated with infrared (IR) light ({\textgreater}700 nm) at 375 W m-2. After inoculation with activated sludge at 0.1 g VSS L-1, PNSB were rapidly enriched in a first batch of 24 h: the genus Rhodobacter reached 54\% of amplicon sequencing read counts. SBR operations at volume exchange ratio of 50\% with decreasing hydraulic retention times (48 to 16 h; 1 to 3 cycles d-1) and increasing volumetric organic loading rates (0.2 to 1.3 kg COD m-3 d-1) stimulated the 2), and accumulation (as high as 3.8 g VSS L-1) of biomass. The sludge retention time (SRT) increased freely from 2.5 to 11 d without controlled sludge wasting. Acetate, ammonium, and orthophosphate were removed simultaneously (up to 96\% at a rate of 1.1 kg COD m-3 d-1, 77\% at 113 g N m-3 d-1, and 73\% at 15 g P m-3 d-1) with a COD:N:P assimilation ratio of 100:6.7:0.9 (m/m/m). Competition for substrate and photons occurred in the PNSB guild. SBR regime shifts sequentially selected for Rhodobacter (90\%) under shorter SRT and non-limiting acetate concentrations during reaction phases, Rhodopseudomonas (70\%) under longer SRT and acetate limitation, and Blastochloris (10\%) under higher biomass concentrations. We highlighted the benefits of a PNSB-based SBR process for biomass accumulation and simultaneous nutrient capture at substantial rates, and its underlying microbial ecology.},

This is at least in part a consequence of the more rapid losses of the polysaccharides in leaves and the hot‐water‐soluble materials in nodes. Internodes also provide a poorer substrate than leaves and nodes for the anaerobes which produce acetic acid. Copyright © 1981 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {Biochar, like most other adsorbents, is a carbonaceous material, which is formed from the combustion of plant materials, in low-zero oxygen conditions and results in a material, which has the capacity to sorb chemicals onto its surfaces. Currently, research is being carried out to investigate the relevance of biochar in improving the soil ecosystem, digestate quality and most recently the anaerobic digestion process. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic substrates provides both a sustainable source of energy and a digestate with the potential to enhance plant growth and soil health. In order to ensure that these benefits are realised, the anaerobic digestion system must be optimized for process stability and high nutrient retention capacity in the digestate produced. Substrate-induced inhibition is a major issue, which can disrupt the stable functioning of the AD system reducing microbial breakdown of the organic waste and formation of methane, which in turn reduces energy output. Likewise, the spreading of digestate on land can often result in nutrient loss, surface runoff and leaching. This review will examine substrate inhibition and their impact on anaerobic digestion, nutrient leaching and their environmental implications, the properties and functionality of biochar material in counteracting these challenges.},

Despite being an established technology, AD still faces key challenges, including process inefficiencies due to substrate-induced instability and product quality assurance; inability to digest highly lignocellulosic biomass without pre-treatment; and management of effluents and emissions. Commercial grade carbon-based materials have been employed as stabilising agent to improve process efficiency. Biochar, a by-product from biomass pyrolysis, has recently been identified as a sustainable alternative material to commercial grade carbon-based adsorbent used in AD. This review highlights the challenges with the AD process and the limitations of the various conventional approaches in its management. An exposition of the characteristics of biochar and the physico-chemical properties of biochar, that can simultaneously promote AD process stability, increase biomethane yield rate and the agronomic quality of digestate, are presented and discussed.},

This review provides an overview of the formation of inhibitory by-products from lignocellulosic feedstocks as a consequence of using different pretreatment methods and feedstocks as well as an overview of different strategies used to alleviate problems with inhibitors. As technologies for biorefining of lignocellulose become mature and are transferred from laboratory environments to industrial contexts, the importance of management of inhibition problems is envisaged to increase as issues that become increasingly relevant will include the possibility to use recalcitrant feedstocks, obtaining high product yields and high productivity, minimizing the charges of enzymes and microorganisms, and using high solids loadings to obtain high product titers.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-94-007-5931-2_12},
	abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) is the waste generated from residential sources, such as households, and from institutional and commercial sources such as offices, schools, hotels and other sources. The main components of MSW are food, garden waste, paper, board, plastic, textile, metal, and glass waste. The composition of MSW varies depending on a range of factors; the household waste reflects population density and economic prosperity, seasonality, housing standards and the presence of waste minimization initiatives. The MSW consists of a high proportion of organic fraction resulting from scraps, food residues, paper and garden waste. The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) represents 70\% of the waste composition with moisture content around 85-90\%. The uncontrolled decomposition of OFMSW can contribute to global warming and result in large-scale contamination of soil, water, and air. Macias-Corral et al. (Bioresour Technol 99:8288-8293, 2008) indicated that the decomposition of one metric ton of OFMSW can potentially release 50-110 m3 of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 90-140 m3 of methane (CH4). In addition, the high levels of moisture content make this type of waste ineffectual for incineration. Therefore, the anaerobic digestion of OFMSW can be an environmentally sustainable technology to reduce the harmful effects of MSW, reduce the volume and toxicity of this waste, in addition to many advantages including potential for energy recovery, production of an end-product suitable for soil conditioning, and decreased dependency on landfills. Anaerobic biodegradation of the organic material proceeds in the absence of oxygen and presence of anaerobic microorganisms. Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is an engineered biological process by which complex organic materials are first hydrolyzed and fermented by acid bacteria into volatile fatty acids that are consumed by methanogenic bacteria and converted into biogas afterwards. The biogas generated can be used as a renewable source of energy, and the solid compost material can be used as soil fertilizer. For all these advantages, the AD technology has been supported by legislation in many countries around the world and encouraged as sustainable solid waste management option. This chapter presents in depth the AD technology to determine its economic and environmental competitiveness, as one of the options for processing the biodegradable organic materials in MSW. The chapter also discusses the stages of the digestion of the waste such as; the pretreatment, the separation processes, waste digestion, gas recovery and residue treatment. The AD operating parameters are illustrated, such as - but not limited to -: waste composition, temperature, organic content, residence time, pH, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and compost quality.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.wasman.2015.10.021},
	abstract = {There is a lack of literature reporting the methane potential of several livestock manures under the same anaerobic digestion conditions (same inoculum, temperature, time, and size of the digester). To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has reported biochemical methane potential (BMP) predicting models developed and evaluated by solely using at least five different livestock manure tests results. The goal of this study was to evaluate the BMP of five different livestock manures (dairy manure (DM), horse manure (HM), goat manure (GM), chicken manure (CM) and swine manure (SM)) and to predict the BMP using different statistical models. Nutrients of the digested different manures were also monitored. The BMP tests were conducted under mesophilic temperatures with a manure loading factor of 3.5g volatile solids (VS)/L and a feed to inoculum ratio (F/I) of 0.5. Single variable and multiple variable regression models were developed using manure total carbohydrate (TC), crude protein (CP), total fat (TF), lignin (LIG) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), and measured BMP data. Three different kinetic models (first order kinetic model, modified Gompertz model and Chen and Hashimoto model) were evaluated for BMP predictions. The BMPs of DM, HM, GM, CM and SM were measured to be 204, 155, 159, 259, and 323mL/g VS, respectively and the VS removals were calculated to be 58.6\%, 52.9\%, 46.4\%, 81.4\%, 81.4\%, respectively. The technical digestion time (T80-90, time required to produce 80-90\% of total biogas production) for DM, HM, GM, CM and SM was calculated to be in the ranges of 19-28, 27-37, 31-44, 13-18, 12-17days, respectively. The effluents from the HM showed the lowest nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations. The effluents from the CM digesters showed highest nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and digested SM showed highest potassium concentration. Based on the results of the regression analysis, the model using the variable of LIG showed the best (R2=0.851, p=0.026) for BMP prediction among the single variable models, and the model including variables of TC and TF showed the best prediction for BMPs (R2=0.913, p=0.068-0.075) comparing with other two-variable models, while the model including variables of CP, LIG and ADF performed the best in BMP prediction (R2=0.999, p=0.009-0.017) if three-variable models were compared. Among the three kinetic models used, the first order kinetic model fitted the measured BMPs data best (R2=0.996-0.998, rRMSE=0.171-0.381) and deviations between measured and the first order kinetic model predicted BMPs were less than 3.0\%.},

Laboratory experiment data from 10 litres batch anaerobic digester operating at ambient mesophilic temperature of 37°C and pH of 6.9 was used to derive parameters for modified Gompertz model. The carbon/nitrogen (CIN) ratio of Pig waste was found to be 16.16 and grass clippings to be 20.54. Through co-digestion in ratio of 1:1, the C/N ratio settled at 17.28. The actual biogas yield was found to be 7725 ml/g COD. In the model of biogas production prediction, the kinetics constants of A (ml/g COD), u (ml/g COD. day), X. (day) was 7920.70, 701.35, 1.61 respectively with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9994. Modified Gompertz plot showed better correlation of cumulative biogas production and these results show biogas production can be enhanced from co-digestion of substrates.},

One of the crucial process steps is the pretreatment of the biomass, which has as primary aim to make the biomass accessible to enzymatic attack, as it has a large impact on all the other steps in the process. Several pretreatment methods have been developed, comprising methods working at low pH, i.e., acid based, at medium pH (without addition of catalysts), or at high pH, i.e., with a base as catalyst. Many methods result in high sugar yields, above 90\% of theoretical for agricultural residues while more recalcitrant materials like hardwood, and especially softwood, require dilute-acid pretreatment to reach high sugar yields. However, most studies on pretreatment have been assessed by enzymatic hydrolysis at low solids content and high enzyme dosages. The various pretreatment methods need in the future to be reassessed at more industrial-like conditions considering the whole integrated process taking into consideration the influence on all process steps.

After pretreatment, each component may be utilized via chemical conversion, hydrolysis, and/or fermentation. In this review we aim first, to identify the current status-quo of knowledge of the parametric effects of ultrasound, second, to evaluate the potential of ultrasound as a pretreatment and fractionation method of lignocellulose, and last, to identify the challenges that this technology faces. Ultrasound produces chemical and physical effects which were both found to augment the pretreatment of lignocellulose via delignification and surface erosion. The magnitudes of these effects are altered when the ultrasonic field is influenced by parameters such as solvent, ultrasonic frequency, and reactor geometry and type. Therefore, the implementation of ultrasound for the pretreatment of lignocellulose must consider the variation of ultrasonic influences to capitalize on the key effects of ultrasound. Currently the literature is dominated by low frequency ultrasonic treatment, coupled with alkaline solutions. High frequency ultrasound, oxidizing solutions, and use of combined alternative augmentation techniques show promise for the reduction of energy consumed and synergistic enhancement of ultrasonic treatment. Furthermore, feedstock characteristics, reactor configuration, kinetics, and the ultrasonic environment should be considered. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most plentifully available biomass resources on the earth. It is composed of three main biopolymers - cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, all of which are cross-linked to each other to resist degradation by enzymes and microorganisms resulting in so-called biomass recalcitrance. The biorefinery process typically consists of three steps: pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation. Energy and cost efficiency of biorefinery is predominantly dependent on how to produce inexpensive sugars from complex cell wall component of lignocellulosic biomass by overcoming biomass recalcitrance. There have been tremendous efforts to develop effective biomass pretreatment technologies for obtaining the highest yield of fermentable sugars from biomass feedstocks at the lowest cost. The present review discusses various pretreatment technologies to understand how to effectively break down biomass into fermentable sugars that are eventually used for microbial fermentation to produce biomass-based fuels, chemicals, and polymers.},

Experimental investigation of physiochemical changes that occur during pretreatment is needed for developing mechanistic and effective models that can be employed for the rational design of pretreatment processes. Various-cutting edge pretreatment technologies (physical, chemical and biological) are being tested on the pilot scale. These different pretreatment methods are widely described in this paper, among them, microaerobic pretreatment (MP) has gained attention as a potential pretreatment method for the degradation of LM, which just requires a limited amount of oxygen (or air) supplied directly during the pretreatment step. MP involves microbial communities under mild conditions (temperature and pressure), uses fewer enzymes and less energy for methane production, and is probably the most promising and environmentally friendly technique in the long run. Moreover, it is technically and economically feasible to use microorganisms instead of expensive chemicals, biological enzymes or mechanical equipment.

Therefore, the technical approaches to overcome recalcitrance of biomass feedstock has been developed to remove the barriers with the help of pretreatment methods which make cellulose more accessible to the hydrolytic enzymes, secreted by the microorganisms, for its conversion to glucose. Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass in cost effective manner is a major challenge to bioethanol technology research and development.

Bioethanol is a major biofuel that can be produced from lignocellulosic materials. Its production typically involves a hydrolysis-fermentation route, which has three main steps: pretreatment to get fermentable sugars, fermentation to produce bioethanol, and a separation process to obtain highly concentrated bioethanol. The pretreatment step has been recognized as a technological bottleneck for the cost-effective development of bioprocesses from lignocellulosic materials. In this work we analyze the potential of several pretreatment methods for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic materials. Simulations based on stoichiometric relations and yield data were conducted to evaluate the energy requirements of each pretreatment method. Other parameters were also considered such as the cost of chemicals, consumption of water, and constraints on the composition of inhibitors. Performance benchmarks were identifies using targeting techniques and these benchmarks were used to assess the actual performance of the alternatives. The combination of the evaluated parameters with target production values obtained from reported yields served as the basis for identifying the most promising pretreatment options and for defining areas of opportunities. This approach uses limited information, but it provides reliable results in order to reduce the number of pretreatment alternatives. The target production usage gives an estimation of the global process efficiency without the completed flowsheet defined. © 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Pre-treatments can increase substrate biodegradability and so biogas yield, but these may need further investigation to determine economic viability. Mathematical modeling has been shown useful in aiding selection of appropriate combinations of substrates and pretreatment for co-digestion (e.g. substrate type and mix ratio). This review also considers the fate of the digestate following such anaerobic co-digestion. The difficulties in implementation of the co-digestion approach need not necessarily be technical in nature but can be due to management issues.},

	abstract = {As an alternative to activated carbon, biochar has been considered for removal of organic micropollutants from water and wastewater via adsorption. This review elaborates on the fundamental basis of adsorption kinetics, mechanisms, and equilibrium with respect to biochar-based adsorption of micropollutants. The objectives include: 1) linking biochar surface properties with adsorption abilities, 2) categorizing the kinetics of adsorption of aqueous-phase organic compounds onto biochar, 3) categorizing the molecular-scale interactions between organic micropollutants and biochar, and 4) reviewing existing quantitative methods for characterizing adsorption equilibrium of organic micropollutants from water onto an adsorbent surface. To fulfill these goals, the relationships among biochar surface properties, adsorption kinetics, mechanisms, and equilibrium were clarified as current literature often lacks such discussion or may include conflicting descriptions. Due to its heterogeneous nature, research on biochar's adsorption potential for micropollutants is ambiguous. By adapting adsorption theories to biochar application specifically, this review helps to inform future research in terms of addressing knowledge gaps in characterizing and improving biochar adsorption.},

	abstract = {Gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) with subsequent utilization of syngas in gas engines/turbines and solid oxide fuel cells can substantially increase the power generation of waste-to-energy facilities and optimize the utilization of wastes as a sustainable energy resources. However, purification of syngas to remove multiple impurities such as particulates, tar, HCl, alkali chlorides and sulfur species is required. This study investigates the feasibility of high temperature purification of syngas from MSW gasification with the focus on catalytic tar reforming and desulfurization. Syngas produced from a downdraft fixed-bed gasifier is purified by a multi-stage system. The system comprises of a fluidized-bed catalytic tar reformer, a filter for particulates and a fixed-bed reactor for dechlorination and then desulfurization with overall downward cascading of the operating temperatures throughout the system. Novel nano-structured nickel catalyst supported on alumina and regenerable Ni-Zn desulfurization sorbent loaded on honeycomb are synthesized. Complementary sampling and analysis methods are applied to quantify the impurities and determine their distribution at different stages. Experimental and thermodynamic modeling results are compared to determine the kinetic constraints in the integrated system. The hot purification system demonstrates up to 90\% of tar and sulfur removal efficiency, increased total syngas yield (14\%) and improved cold gas efficiency (12\%). The treated syngas is potentially applicable in gas engines/turbines and solid oxide fuel cells based on the dew points and concentration limits of the remaining tar compounds. Reforming of raw syngas by nickel catalyst for over 20 h on stream shows strong resistance to deactivation. Desulfurization of syngas from MSW gasification containing significantly higher proportion of carbonyl sulfide than hydrogen sulfide, traces of tar and hydrogen chloride demonstrates high performance of Ni-Zn sorbents.},

	abstract = {Nickel-based catalysts were synthesized using gasification slag as an abundant and inexpensive material with high mechanical strength. The synthesis procedure comprised of etching of gasification slag with hydrofluoric acid, aluminum hydroxide addition, impregnation with Ni and calcination. The naphthalene reforming activity was tested at 850 °C and 24,000 h−1 gas hourly space velocity in the presence of 50 ppmv H2S and 300 ppmv HCl in gas. The presence of aluminum hydroxide and an oxidizing environment during the calcination process were essential for preparation of active catalysts. The addition of 30\% of aluminum hydroxide to gasification slag improved the dispersion of Ni oxide and increased the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area determined by N2 adsorption at −196 °C from 4.5 to 15.0 m2 g−1 as compared to the catalyst without aluminum hydroxide. This resulted in the increased naphthalene conversion from 35 to 86\%. The activity of Ni in synthesized slag catalyst was approximately 3.2 times higher than in commercial catalyst due to the deposition of Ni on the outer surface of catalyst particles. The deposited Al and Ni species were firmly attached to the slag particles during calcination at 500–1000 °C. While high calcination temperature was beneficial for high mechanical strength of catalyst, the procedure should be conducted under oxidizing environment. When calcination was carried out in N2 environment at 1000 °C, the sintering of catalyst particles and encapsulation of Ni occurred, which drastically decreased the BET specific surface area to 0.4 m2 g−1 and naphthalene conversion to 30\%. These negative effects could be prevented when air was used during calcination, which facilitated earlier crystallization and inhibited excessive sintering of catalyst, thus, maintaining the high catalytic activity.},

	abstract = {A series of Ni-Zn-based nanocomposites with various Ni:Zn mol ratios was prepared using a facile hydrothermal-calcination method. The Ni-Zn-based nanocomposites were characterized using XRD, FESEM, EDX and N2 adsorption, indicating that all the Ni-Zn-based nanocomposites consisted of hierarchical nanostructure. The Ni-Zn-based nanocomposites were used as sorbents for desulfurization of simulated syngas. It was found that the optimum Ni:Zn mol ratio for preparing highly-regenerable sorbent was 2:5 and hence, this ratio was used to prepare the Ni-Zn-based nanocomposite loaded on cordierite mullite honeycomb (NiZn-28-HC). The characterization study revealed that the immobilized Ni-Zn-based nanostructure consisted of seaweed-like morphology with 10 µm thickness. After 5 desulfurization-regeneration cycles, the NiZn-28-HC demonstrated only a minor loss in the desulfurization performance. Investigation of the surface chemical states using XPS revealed that the marginal sorbent deactivation during repeated desulfurization-regeneration cycles was mainly due to the formation of sulfate. The influence of HCl on the desulfurization-regeneration cycle was also studied, showing that the presence of HCl can inhibit the desulfurization process due to competition reaction with sulfur compounds for sorption onto the sorbent active sites. However, it was found that HCl up to 50 ppmv has no significant influence on the performance and regenerability of the sorbent. The results indicated that the NiZn-28-HC is a promising sorbent with high reactivity and stability for syngas desulfurization.},

	abstract = {Tar, one of the most challenging impurities in the syngas generated from the gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW), can severely restrict its applicability in advanced utilization systems such as solid oxide fuel cells, gas engines and combined cycle gas turbines. Due to the complexity in sampling and analysis of tar, very limited studies have explored the development of comprehensive analytical procedure to provide insights into the distribution of GC–MS detectable tar compounds, GC–MS undetectable tar residues and inorganic impurities in the syngas from MSW gasification. In this study, Syngas generated from a downdraft fixed-bed gasifier (under different operating conditions) was sampled and analysed to understand the changes in the distributions of tar compounds and to verify the applicability of a sequential analytical procedure for syngas with different contents and distributions of tar and inorganic impurities. The procedure was developed to analyse and quantify the tar compounds and inorganic impurities in tar sampling solutions. The GC–MS analysis of three types of tar containing solutions (collected tar, gravimetric tar solution and evaporated condensate), gravimetric tar procedure (rotary evaporation and weighing), three separation/isolation methods (adsorption, dilution and decomposition) and quantification of inorganic compounds (cations and anions) were studied. With this sequential analytical procedure, enhanced detection and quantification (EDQ) of GC–MS detectable tar compounds at low concentration and correction on the GC–MS undetectable tar contents based on quantification of inorganic impurities were achieved. Distribution of tar and inorganic impurities was determined which revealed the impacts of operating conditions on syngas from MSW gasification.},

	abstract = {The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which was officially declared by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, some of which have been known to cause common colds. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation from person-to-person and aerosol/droplet transmission, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of COVID-19 patients but in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. Currently available data are also limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.},

	abstract = {Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool. Therefore, the quantification of SARS- CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections amongst the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater. Journal},

	abstract = {Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stools and sewage has recently been reported, raising the hypothesis of faecal-oral transmission. If confirmed, this could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies. In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions. Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.},

In this study, we evaluated in four WTCs the presence of 11 viral pathogens of particular concern in this milieu and used a metagenomic approach to characterize the total viral community in the air of one of those WTCs. The presence of viruses in aerosols in different locations of individual WTCs was evaluated and the results obtained with four commonly used air samplers were compared. We detected four of the eleven viruses tested, including human adenovirus (hAdV), rotavirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Herpes Simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). The results of the metagenomic assay uncovered very few viral RNA sequences in WTC aerosols, however sequences from human DNA viruses were in much greater relative abundance.},

	abstract = {With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US\$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.},

Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses. The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management. We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by {\textasciitilde}5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.

However, little is known about the presence and fate of enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and ø6) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and ø6 remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26\% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6\% of the two nonenveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (±SD) of 25.1\% (±3.6\%) and 18.2\% (±9.5\%) for the enveloped MHV and ø6, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6\% (±16.7\%) and 85.5\% (±24.5\%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, respectively. A maximum of 3.7\% of MHV and 2\% of MS2 could be recovered from the solids. These results shed light on the environmental fate of an important group of viruses and the presented methods will enable future research on enveloped viruses in water environments.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062679},
	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19. Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from 5 March to 23 April 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since 17 March 2020).We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. As a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 ci rculation at the local or regional scale.},

The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.},

Extracted data were as follows: RNA or DNA genome, enveloped or not, primary transmission pathway, temperature, pH, light levels, and matrix. From the primary details, we further determined matrix level of contamination, genus, and taxonomic family. Prior to model construction, three records were separated for verification. A censored normal regression model provided the best fit model, which predicted T90 from DNA or RNA structure, enveloped status, whether primary transmission pathway was fecal-oral, temperature, and whether contamination was low, medium, or high. Model residuals and predicted values were evaluated against observed values. Mean values of model predictions were compared to independent data and considering 95\% confidence ranges (which could be quite large). A relatively simple model can predict virus inactivation rates from virus and matrix attributes, providing valuable input when formulating risk management strategies for little studied pathogens.},

In the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment, cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies are urgently needed. Methods: Here, we have used RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples collected during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the Region of Valencia, Spain. Results: We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases. Interpretation: Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and show that wastewater analysis is a sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewer systems for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE). During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection occurred in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in both areas at high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2. The study shows that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.},

	abstract = {Background: An outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020. We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, a member of the coronavirus family of respiratory viruses that includes SARS-CoV-1 and MERS. COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by SARS- CoV-2, has evolved into a global pandemic with more than 2,900,000 people infected. It has had an acute and dramatic impact on health care systems, economies, and societies of affected countries within these few months. Widespread testing and tracing efforts are employed in many countries in order to contain and mitigate this pandemic. Recent data has indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that the virus can be detected in wastewater. This indicates that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large populations at relevant scales. Collecting raw sewage data, representing specific districts, and crosslinking this data with the number of infected people from each location, will enable us to derive and provide quantitative surveillance tools. In particular, this will provide important means to (i) estimate the extent of outbreaks and their spatial distributions, based primarily on in-sewer measurements (ii) manage the early-warning system quantitatively and efficiently (and similarly, verify disease elimination). Here we report the development of a virus concentration method using PEG or alum, providing an important a tool for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage and relating it to the local populations and geographic information. This will provide a proof of concept for the use of sewage associated virus data as a reliable epidemiological tool.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and became a global pandemic [1]. By 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and over 203 thousand people lost their life globally. By 26 April 2020, 107773 confirmed cases were reported in Turkey with 2706 deaths. Majority of the cases in Turkey has been observed in Istanbul. In the world, the duration of availability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples [2]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewaters in Australia [3], Netherlands [4], USA [5], France [6], Spain [7] and USA [8] by using different virus concentration techniques. In this work, Istanbul metropole with 65 \% of Covid-19 cases was chosen as the pilot city. On the 21st of April 2020, 24-hr composite samples were collected from the Ambarli, Pasakoy and Kadikoy wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). On the 25th of April 2020, more wastewater samples were taken from Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs. These wastewater treatment plants were selected among 81 plants in Istanbul in order to take representative samples from 4 different districts of Istanbul according to the severity of Covid-19 cases, like very serious, serious, moderate and mild. Grab samples were also collected from Bagcilar and Kartal manholes located nearby the pandemic hospitals on April 21st, 2020. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) adsorption [5] SARS-Cov-2 concentration method was used for SARS-CoV-2 concentration after optimization. Real time RT-PCR diagnostic panel validated by US was used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage taken from the inlets of treatment plants and manholes. Five samples out of seven from wastewater and all samples from manholes were tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage from Ambarli, Pasakoy, Kadikoy, Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs were found as 8.26x103, 1.80x104, ND, ND, 3.73x103, 4.95x103, 2.89x103, respectively. The Bagcilar and Kartal manholes nearby pandemic hospitals exhibited 4.49x104 and 9.33x104, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 virus titers of manhole were higher than those of inlet of WWTPs. The observed copy numbers were presented against the number of Covid-19 cases coming to the WWTP per treatment plant capacity. Quantitative measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used as a tool in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and it can provide information about SARS- CoV-2 distribution in wastewater of various districts of Istanbul which exhibit different scores of Covid- 19 cases. The distribution of epidemy was followed not only with blood test but with wastewater monitoring. This may allow us to identify the districts not exhibiting many Covid-19 cases, but under high risk. Continuous monitoring of wastewater for SARS-Cov-2 may provide an early warning signs before an epidemy starts in case of infection resurge.},

In the present study, raw and treated samples from three wastewater treatment plants, and two river samples characterized the Milano Metropolitan Area, Italy, were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity to real time PCR and infectiveness. Moreover, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains was performed. Raw wastewater samples resulted positive to PCR amplification, while treated water samples were always negative (four and two samples, respectively, sampled in two dates). Moreover, the rate of positivity in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, in congruence with the epidemiological trend estimated for the interested provinces. Virus infectiveness was always not significant, indicating the effectiveness of wastewater treatments, or the natural decay of viral vitality, which implied the absence of significant risk of infection from wastewaters. Samples from receiving rivers (two sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to PCR amplification, probably due to non-treated discharges, or the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers vitality was negligible, indicating the absence of sanitary risks. Phylogenetic analysis of genome indicated that the isolated virus belongs to the most spread strain present in Europe and similar to another strain found in Lombardy.},

	abstract = {Solid biomass fuel use is closely intertwined with the life of rural households in Asia. However, its consumption and demand vary significantly across different countries, states and in various agro-climatic zones. Uses of solid biomass fuel in the kitchen not only leads to household air pollution but also influences the air quality in the regions of Indo- Gangetic plains. Considering this, current study assesses the household fuel use pattern and trend in India. Further, the socio-cultural, economical and behavioral factors which can influence the household fuel choice were evaluated through a case study from Punjab, India using a standard questionnaire. The decadal trend in household energy consumption pattern shows that 77.5\% of rural households in India rely on solid biomass fuel for cooking. Further, during the last 30 years (upto 2011), only 2\% of rural households shifted from solid biomass fuel to cleaner fuels. However, after 2011 data shows significant uptake of the cleaner fuels for the household cooking purposes. Results of the case study show that rural households depend on numerous approaches rather than relying on a particular source of household energy. This contradicts the energy ladder hypothesis of improvement in energy source with an increase in income. Cooking fuel preferences were found to be significantly determined by socio-economic and cultural factors. Thus, providing improved cookstoves or cleaner fuels are not sufficient to attain their sustained use. Hence, the current study highlights the need for effective user-behavior focused interventions to enhance the transition towards cleaner fuel for household energy.},

	abstract = {Population growth will lead to an increase in food demand, which will exert pressure on crop production and likely increase the agricultural crop residue. The present study estimates atmospheric emissions of various pollutants from crop residue burning using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines. In India 488 Mt of total crop residue was generated during 2017, and about 24\% of it was burnt in agricultural fields. This resulted in emissions of 824 Gg of Particulate Matter (PM2.5), 58 Gg of Elemental Carbon (EC) and 239 Gg of Organic Carbon (OC). Additionally, 211 Tg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) were also added to the atmosphere. However, crop residue can also be used for energy production in biomass power plants and has the potential of 120 TWh of electricity generation. This accounts for 10\% of the total energy production of India. Trend analysis in a Business As Usual (BAU) model shows that crop residue burning emissions will increase by 45\% in 2050 having 2017 as the base year. The study also examines the various sustainable approaches and proposes an integrated crop residue management model to minimize the adverse impact of agricultural waste burning on human health and the environment.},

The traditional practice of open burning of residues (System A) was compared with the alternative of converting residues to biochar, which was returned to the same land area from which the residues were obtained (System B). Pyrolytic cook-stoves and drum ovens were assumed to be used by households to produce biochar, and the cook-stoves produced heat energy for cooking. The annual rate of biochar applied was determined by the amount of biochar produced from the straw and husk available. We assumed that agronomic effects of biochar increased with each annual biochar application until reaching maximum benefits at 18 Mg ha-1, which takes eight years to be produced in pyrolytic cook-stoves and drum ovens. The largest contributor to the carbon footprint of rice at the mill gate, was CH4 emissions from soil, in both systems. Biochar addition reduced the carbon footprint of spring rice and summer rice by 26\% and 14\% respectively, compared with System A, in the first year of application. These values substantially increased to 49\% and 38\% after eight years of biochar addition. The climate effect of System B was most sensitive to the assumed suppression of soil CH4 emissions due to biochar application.},

	abstract = {In the north west Indo-Gangetic Plain (N.W.IGP), large scale post-harvest paddy residue fires occur every year during the months of October-November. This anthropogenic perturbation causes contamination of the atmospheric environment with adverse impacts on regional air quality posing health risks for the population exposed to high concentrations of carcinogens such as benzene and toxic VOCs such as isocyanic acid. These gases and carbon monoxide are known to be emitted from biomass fires along with acetonitrile. Yet no long-term in-situ measurements quantifying the impact of this activity have been carried out in the N.W. IGP. Using high quality continuous online in-situ measurements of these gases at a strategic downwind site over a three year period from 2012 to 2014, we demonstrate the strong impact of this anthropogenic emission activity on ambient concentrations of these gases. In contrast to the pre-paddy harvest period, excellent correlation of benzenoids, isocyanic acid and CO with acetonitrile (a biomass burning chemical tracer); (r ≥ 0.82) and distinct VOC/acetonitrile emission ratios were observed for the post-paddy harvest period which was also characterized by high ambient concentrations of these species. The average concentrations of acetonitrile (1.62 ± 0.18 ppb), benzene (2.51 ± 0.28 ppb), toluene (3.72 ± 0.41 ppb), C8-aromatics (2.88 ± 0.30 ppb), C9-aromatics (1.55 ± 0.19 ppb) and CO (552 ± 113 ppb) in the post-paddy harvest periods were about 1.5 times higher than the annual average concentrations. For isocyanic acid, a compound with both primary and secondary sources, the concentration in the post-paddy harvest period was 0.97 ± 0.17 ppb. The annual average concentrations of benzene, a class A carcinogen, exceeded the annual exposure limit of 1.6 ppb at NTP mandated by the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of India (NAAQS). We show that mitigating the post-harvest paddy residue fires can lower the annual average concentration of benzene and ensure compliance with the NAAQS. Calculations of excessive lifetime cancer risk due to benzene amount to 25 and 10 per million inhabitants for children and adults, respectively, exceeding the USEPA threshold of 1 per million inhabitants. Annual exposure to isocyanic acid was close to 1 ppb, the concentration considered to be sufficient to enhance risks for cardiovascular diseases and cataracts. This study makes a case for urgent mitigation of post-harvest paddy residue fires as the unknown synergistic effect of multi-pollutant exposure due to emissions from this anthropogenic source may be posing grave health risks to the population of the N.W.

The dependency in fossil fuel is leading the world into a complex crisis comprising the insecurity of supplies, environment impact and also the fluctuation of fuel price. With a view to tackle this crisis, scientists are shifting their interest on new energy sources like biomass resources, solar, tidal and geothermal energies. Among these, biomass resources have been around for domestic use for a long time, but have not yet been utilised for industrial-scale power generation. Whereas other renewable sources have a long way to go in the path to technological advancement to be utilised in a mass scale and compete with fossil fuel as a cost-effective alternative. The most potential biomass resource is lignocellulosic biomass, which includes paddy residue. Paddy residues are widely abundant agricultural wastes which have a high potential for utilisation in energy industries. The major challenges for the proper utilisation of paddy residues in power generation are management, lack of economic study, and lack of collection network. Lastly, the economic, environment and energy policies play an important role for developing paddy residues as a fuel for energy industries.},

	abstract = {Methanogenesis is an essential part of the global carbon cycle and a key bioprocess for sustainable energy. Methanogenesis from organic matter is accomplished by syntrophic interactions among different species of microbes, in which interspecies electron transfer (IET) via diffusive carriers (e.g. hydrogen and formate) is known to be the bottleneck step. We report herein that the supplementation of soil microbes with (semi)conductive iron-oxide minerals creates unique interspecies interactions and facilitates methanogenesis. Methanogenic microbes were enriched from rice paddy field soil with either acetate or ethanol as a substrate in the absence or presence of (semi)conductive iron oxides (haematite or magnetite). We found that the supplementation with either of these iron oxides resulted in the acceleration of methanogenesis in terms of lag time and production rate, while the supplementation with an insulative iron oxide (ferrihydrite) did not. Clone-library analyses of 16S rRNA gene fragments PCR-amplified from the enrichment cultures revealed that the iron-oxide supplementation stimulated the growth of Geobacter spp. Furthermore, the addition of a specific inhibitor for methanogenesis suppressed the growth of Geobacter spp. These results suggest that Geobacter grew under syntrophic association with methanogens, and IET could occur via electric currents through (semi)conductive iron-oxide minerals (termed 'electric syntrophy'). Given the ubiquity of conductive minerals in nature, such energetic interactions may occur widely in soil and sediments and can be used to develop efficient bioenergy processes. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Granular activated carbon (GAC) is added to methanogenic digesters to enhance conversion of wastes to methane, but the mechanism(s) for GAC's stimulatory effect are poorly understood. GAC has high electrical conductivity and thus it was hypothesized that one mechanism for GAC stimulation of methanogenesis might be to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between bacteria and methanogens. Metabolism was substantially accelerated when GAC was added to co-cultures of Geobacter metallireducens and Geobacter sulfurreducens grown under conditions previously shown to require DIET. Cells were attached to GAC, but did not aggregate as they do when making biological electrical connections between cells. Studies with a series of gene deletion mutants eliminated the possibility that GAC promoted electron exchange via interspecies hydrogen or formate transfer and demonstrated that DIET in the presence of GAC did not require the electrically conductive pili and associated c-type cytochrome involved in biological interspecies electrical connections. GAC also greatly stimulated ethanol metabolism and methane production in co-cultures of G. metallireducens and Methanosarcina barkeri. Cells were attached to GAC, but not closely aggregated, suggesting little opportunity for biological electrical contacts between the species. GAC also enhanced methane production in samples from a methanogenic digester in which Methanosaeta were the predominant methanogens. The results demonstrate that GAC can promote DIET and suggest that stimulation of metabolism in methanogenic digesters can be attributed, at least in part, to the high conductivity of GAC providing better interspecies electrical connections than those that can be forged biologically. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

However, the process performance and environmental sustainability of adding con- ductive materials into AD under different temperature conditions have not been addressed. In this study, four different groups of lab-scale reactors were operated under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions and with/without activated carbon (AC) addition. Based on the lab-scale results, a pilot-scale reactor was used to highlight the effectiveness of activated carbon addition, and the derived data was used for a life cycle assessment (LCA) study. The results showed the enhancement of methane production by adding AC, particularly under thermophilic conditions. At the organic loading rate of 4.7 g VS/L/d, the average methane yield of the ther- mophilic AD reactors with AC was 550 mL CH4/g VS, which was significantly higher than that of the control reactors (i.e. 220 mL CH4/g VS). Adding AC into AD reactors accelerated the shift of dominant methanogenic pathways from aceticlastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by enriching Methanoculleus (84\% of total archaea). The LCA results highlighted the environmental benefits of using activated carbon to enhance AD of food waste at both midpoint and endpoint levels based on ReCiPe2016 methodology.},

Biochar also simultaneously enhanced the production and degradation of intermediate acids. The fingerprint and sequencing analysis used to examine the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of communities revealed that proportion of Archaea was higher in the biochar-added treatments and in the tightly-bound fractions. Methanosarcina located in the tightly-bound fractions on the biochar surface, and was most abundant in the larger 2-5mm biochar particles. Methanosaeta was enriched in the loosely-bound fractions by all-size biochar particles and within the tightly-bound fractions by small biochar particles. Because biochar is cost-effective and can remain in digestate for direct use as soil amendment without separation, eco-compatible biochar may serve as a good substrate for highly-loaded digestion by inducing selective colonization of functional microbes.},

This review comprehensively presents recent findings of DIET and the addition of conductive materials for methanogenesis and summarizes important results through aspects of electron flux, organic degradation, and microbial interaction. Conductive materials improve DIET and methanogenesis by acting as either substitute of e-pili or electron conduit between e-pili and electron acceptors. Other effects of conductive materials such as the change of redox potential may also be important factors for the stimulation. The type and organic loading rate of substrates affect the occurrence of DIET and stimulating effects of conductive materials. Geobacter, which can participate in DIET, were less enriched in anaerobic systems cultivated with non-ethanol substrates, suggesting the existence of other syntrophs with the capability of DIET. The coupling of communication systems such as quorum sensing may be a good strategy to achieve the formation of biofilm or granule enriched with syntrophic partners capable of DIET.},

Various conductive materials (CMs) have been applied in anaerobic digesters to improve the performance of anaerobic fermentation and methanogenesis, including carbon-based CMs and metal-based CMs. Generally, CMs facilitated the AD thermodynamically and kinetically because they triggered more efficient syntrophic metabolism to increase electron capture capability and accelerate reaction rate as well as enhance the performance of AD stages (hydrolysis-acidification, methanogenesis). Besides, adding CMs into anaerobic digester is benefit to dealing with the deteriorating AD, which induced from temperature variation, acidified working condition, higher H2 partial pressure, etc. However, few CMs exhibited inhibition on AD, including ferrihydrite, magnesium oxide, silver nanoparticles and carbon black. Inhibition comes from a series of complex factors, such as substrate competition, direct inhibition from Fe(III), Fe(III) reduction of methanogens, toxic effects to microorganisms and mass transfer limitation.},

Biochar showed a remarkable buffering capacity to alleviate pH decrease caused by VFAs accumulation. In order to gain knowledge on associated mechanisms, a specific experiment was conducted using butyrate as substrate.

Six 4·4 litre laboratory digesters, with operating volumes of 3·4 litre, were tested for 18 months with dairy cow manure combined with either barley straw, rice hulls or rice straw in three separate six-month phases. Non-lignin-carbon to nitrogen ratios of the various feed mixtures ranged between 12·3 and 40. Results indicate that methane production from fresh dairy manure can be enhanced by addition of chopped field crop residues. The maximum performance occurs when the non-lignin-carbon to nitrogen ratio of these feed mixtures is between 25 and 32.

The aggregates were electrically conductive, with conductivities 3-fold higher than the conductivities previously reported for dual-species aggregates of Geobacter species in which the two species appeared to exchange electrons via interspecies electron transfer. The temperature dependence response of the aggregate conductance was characteristic of the organic metallic-like conductance previously described for the conductive pili of Geobacter sulfurreducens and was inconsistent with electron conduction through minerals. Studies in which aggregates were incubated with high concentrations of potential electron donors demonstrated that the aggregates had no significant capacity for conversion of hydrogen to methane. The aggregates converted formate to methane but at rates too low to account for the rates at which that the aggregates syntrophically metabolized ethanol, an important component of the reactor influent. Geobacter species comprised 25\% of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from the aggregates, suggesting that Geobacter species may have contributed to some but probably not all of the aggregate conductivity. Microorganisms most closely related to the acetate-utilizing Methanosaeta concilii accounted for more than 90\% of the sequences that could be assigned to methane producers, consistent with the poor capacity for hydrogen and formate utilization. These results demonstrate for the first time that methanogenic wastewater aggregates can be electrically conductive and suggest that direct interspecies electron transfer could be an important mechanism for electron exchange in some methanogenic systems.},

Compost quality assessed by evaluating different maturity and stability indices at five succeeding stages [first mesophilic (M1), thermophilic (T), second mesophilic (M2), cooling (C) and humification (H)]. A significant reduction was observed in the C:N ratio, biodegradability index, nitrification index, ratio of water-soluble carbon to organic nitrogen (WSC/Org.N) with an increase in concomitant over time while Ash (\%), organic matter loss (\%), CEC/TOC ratio, cellulose biodegradation ratio (BR) and lignin/cellulose ratio were significantly increased with time. By correlation study, biodegradability index (BI) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis emerged as the most suitable compost maturity and stability parameters, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) results confirmed that BI, BR, WSC/Org. N and FDA can be regarded as key indicators for assessing compost quality. Our findings conclude that fungal consortia of Tricoderma viride, Rhizomucor pusillus, Aspergillus awamori and Aspergillus flavus can accelerate decomposition time from 8 to 12 months (which is normal farming practice) to 120 days.},

Compared to liquid state anaerobic digestion (LS-AD), SS-AD has multiple advantages including high organic loading, minimal digestate generated, and low energy requirement for heating. However, the main disadvantages limiting the efficiency of SS-AD are long solid retention time, incomplete mixing, and an accumulation of inhibitors. For a successful and efficient SS-AD, it is important to control operation parameters such as nutrient levels, C/N ratio, feedstock-to-inoculum ratio, pH, temperature, and mixing. Biogas production in SS-AD performance can be enhanced by feedstock pretreatment, co-digestion, and supplement of additives such as biochar. The aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive summary of the current development in SS-AD as an effective way for treating solid waste materials.},

The basic technology is well implemented, but the improvements are still under way in terms of optimization and pre-and post-treatments of the feed and end-products, respectively. The purpose of this review is mainly to: (1) provide existing knowledge and research advances in D-AnBioC systems to treat high-solid OS; (2) identify major issues involved in bioreactor designing; (3) present factors influencing the bio-conversion efficiency; (4) discuss the microbiology of system operation; (5) provide examples of existing commercial scale plants; (6) discuss energy and economics requirements. From the detailed literature review, it is clear that the characteristics of OS are the major factors governing the overall process and economics. It shows that not all OS are profitably recycled using D-AnBioC systems. Compared to single-stage continuous systems, batch systems under a multi-stage configuration appears to be economically feasible, however, it must be noted that the available data sets are still inconclusive. Also, limited information is available on green house gas mitigation and restoration of nutrients from the digested residue during post-treatment schemes.

Results showed that thermo-chemical pre-treatments were the most efficient on Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) solubilization, which could reach 83\% at 170°C with pH=12. Yet, increase in COD solubilization. in thermo-chemical pre-treatment was not linked to an increase in soluble Volatile Solids (VS) as optimal conditions were 170°C, and 130°C with pH=10, for this criterion. So, temperature was found to be the most influential parameter on COD and VS solubilization. Biodegradability batch anaerobic tests confirmed results obtained on WAS solubilization, that is to say that 170°C and 130°C with pH=10 were optimal conditions, with respectively 45\% and 21\% of anaerobic digestion enhancement. Thus these two conditions were chosen for sludge treatment before continuous anaerobic digestion. Results, after stabilization have shown a better efficiency of 170°C compared with 130°C with pH=10 pre-treatment, since after anaerobic digestion it led to 71\% of COD degradation and 59\% of Total Solids (TS) degradation, with an improvement of 54\% in biogas production. The main differences between those two pre-treatments could be due to the pre-treatments themselves more than to an effect on anaerobic digestion, because the first one led to a partial loss of WAS COD (near 17\% of initial COD) and the second one to an increase in TS due to addition of base. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.},

It consists of preliminary domestic grinding of MSWOF, its discharge into the sewer, screening, and ®nal digestion of the resulting residue together with sewage sludge. In order to avoid extension work of the present activated sludge sections necessary to face the organic load increase, a ®ne screening is necessary, while the ef®ciency of anaerobic digestion can be improved by shifting the system from mesophilic (37 °C) to thermophilic (55 °C) conditions. The effects of thermal, chemical, and biological pretreatments of both MSWOF and sewage sludge on methane, carbon dioxide, and biogas productions are investigated either separately or jointly. During these pretreatments, volatile suspended solid (VSS) concentration remarkably decreased while soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) increased as the result of the progressive hydrolysis of the polymeric materials present in the feed. Finally, the kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis of these materials are estimated and compared in order to provide useful information on the factors limiting the anaerobic digestion as well as to suggest the best way to carry out the process on a large scale.},

	abstract = {The performance of thermophilic digestion of waste activated sludge, either untreated or thermal pretreated, was evaluated through semi-continuous tests carried out at organic loading rates in the range of 1-3.7kgVS/m3d.Although the thermal pretreatment at T=. 134. °C proved to be effective in solubilizing organic matter, no significant gain in organics degradation was observed. However, the digestion of pretreated sludge showed significant soluble COD removal (more than 55\%) whereas no removal occurred in control reactors. The lower the initial sludge biodegradability, the higher the efficiency of thermal pretreated digestion was observed, in particular as regards higher biogas and methane production rates with respect to the parallel untreated sludge digestion. Heat balance of the combined thermal hydrolysis/thermophilic digestion process, applied on full-scale scenarios, showed positive values for direct combustion of methane. In case of combined heat and power generation, attractive electric energy recoveries were obtained, with a positive heat balance at high load. © 2013.},

About 90\% of methane yield was obtained after 24.5. days of digestion, with total methane yield of 272.1. mL/g VS. Based the preferred ratio, effect of total solids (TS) content on co-digestion of food waste and green waste was evaluated over a TS range of 5-25\%. Results showed that methane yields from high-solids anaerobic digestion (15-20\% TS) were higher than the output of liquid anaerobic digestion (5-10\% TS), while methanogenesis was inhibited by further increasing the TS content to 25\%.

The literature on the adsorptive removal of antibiotics using different adsorptive materials is summarized and critically reviewed, by comparing different adsorbents with varying physicochemical characteristics.

In the present study, anaerobic sludges from three methanogenic reactors feeding cattle manure (CS), sewage sludge (SS) and gaseous H2/CO2 (GS) were used to investigate the effect of microbial consortia composition on syngas bio- methanation. The results showed that CS presented the highest CO consumption rate due to its highest relative abundance of CO consuming bacteria. The CO was mainly converted to acetate, and syntrophic acetate oxidi- zation (SAO) bacteria converted acetate to H2/CO2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in CS and SS. However, acetate was accumulated in GS for lacking acetoclastic methanogens and SAO bacteria, leading to lower biomethanation efficiency. Additionally, adding stoichiometric H2 could convert CO and CO2 to nearly pure methane, while, the CO consumption rate declined in H2 added systems. The results present novel insights into microbial consortia on CO conversion and syngas biomethanation. 1.},

	abstract = {Solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) and composting are two potential alternatives to divert yard trimmings from landfills. This study aimed to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of commercial-scale SS-AD and composting systems (20,000 metric tons (MT)/year) that received both yard trimmings and liquid AD effluent using a modeling software, SuperPro Designer. Both the SS-AD and composting systems were shown to be economically feasible. While their revenues were comparable (\$48/MT), SS-AD with digestate drying showed a higher capital cost (\$256/MT vs. \$84/MT) but a lower non-facility-dependent operating cost (\$11/MT vs. \$21/MT) than composting. The payback time, internal rate of return (IRR), and net present value (NPV) were estimated to be ∼10 years, 8\%, and \$0.2 million, respectively, for SS-AD, and ∼4.9 years, 33\%, and \$1.8 million, respectively, for composting. Digestate drying was necessary to make SS-AD profitable via the sale of byproduct, but it was also the most energy intensive step, relying on heat recovery to reduce costs. Moreover, the economics of SS-AD were highly improved (NPV \$2 million) with financial incentives (i.e. investment tax credits), indicating that incentives were critical to the economic feasibility of current SS-AD systems that utilize lignocellulosic biomass. However, renewable identification numbers (RINs) and renewable energy certificates (RECs) had minor effects. Furthermore, the economics of both systems were most sensitive to plant size, tipping fees, and byproduct/compost price. The results suggest SS-AD may be favored for centralized management while composting for de-centralized management of yard trimmings. Alternative ways to valorize digestate should be evaluated in future studies.},

Wastewater treatment systems are potential recipients of SWCNTs containing influent, yet the impacts of SWCNTs on these systems are poorly documented. In this study, the microbial responses to SWCNTs in simulated phenol wastewater treatment systems were investigated. The phenol removal rates were improved in all SWCNTs-treated sequencing batch reactors during the first 20 days, but when facing higher phenol concentration (1000 mg/L) after 60 days, reactors with the highest concentration (3.5 g/L) of SWCNTs exhibited a notably decreased phenol removal capacity. Cell viability tests, scanning electron microscopy analysis and DNA leakage data suggested that SWCNTs protected microbes from inactivation, possibly by producing more bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which could create a protective barrier for the microbes. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that the bacterial diversity did not change significantly except for a minor reduction after the immediate addition of SWCNTs. Bacterial community structure significantly shifted after SWCNTs addition and did not recover afterward. Zoogloea increased significantly upon SWCNTs shocking. At the final stage, Rudaea and Mobilicoccus increased, while Burkholderia, Singulisphaera, Labrys and Mucilaginibacter decreased notably. The shifts of these dominant genera may be associated with altered sludge settling, aromatic degradation and EPS production. This study suggested that SWCNTs exerted protective rather than cytotoxic effects on sludge microbes of phenol wastewater treatment systems and they affected the bacterial community structure and diversity at test concentrations. These findings provide new insights into our understanding of the potential effects of SWCNTs on wastewater treatment processes.},

Gasification can add value by transforming the waste to low or medium heating value fuel which can be used as a source of clean energy or co-fired with other fuels in current power systems. Wastewater sludge is a good source of sustainable fuel after fuel reforming with steam gasification. The use of steam is shown to provide value added characteristics to the sewage sludge with increased hydrogen content as well total energy. Results obtained on the syngas properties from sewage sludge are presented here at various steam to carbon ratios at a reactor temperature of 1173. K. Effect of steam to carbon ratio on syngas properties are evaluated with specific focus on the amounts of syngas yield, syngas composition, hydrogen yield, energy yield, and apparent thermal efficiency. The apparent thermal efficiency is similar to cold gas efficiency used in industry and was determined from the ratio of energy in syngas to energy in the solid sewage sludge feedstock. A laboratory scale semi-batch type gasifier was used to determine the evolutionary behavior of the syngas properties using calibrated experiments and diagnostic facilities. Results showed an optimum steam to carbon ratio of 5.62 for the range of conditions examined here for syngas yield, hydrogen yield, energy yield and energy ratio of syngas to sewage sludge fuel. The results show that steam gasification provided 25\% increase in energy yield as compared to pyrolysis at the same temperature. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Due to the avoidance of energy-intensive dewatering, hydrothermal conversion of sewage sludge becomes a promising technology to simultaneously achieve energy recovery and solid waste management. In order to obtain an entire understanding of applicability of hydrothermal gasification for hydrogen rich gas production from sewage sludge, this review article discussed hydrothermal conversion and gasification processes in terms of fundamental principles, operating conditions, partial oxidative gasification, and detrimental effects of intermediates. Furthermore, since organic compounds in sewage sludge are mainly composed of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and lignin, this article comprehensively reviewed hydrogen production from these biomass model compounds and their hydrolysis products under sub- and supercritical water. Additionally, introduction of alkali salts and heterogeneous catalysts to enhance hydrogen yield under mild temperatures and pressures in hydrothermal gasification process was also discussed. Based on bench and pilot scale studies, supercritical water gasification of sewage sludge for hydrogen production is feasible in terms of technical and economic evaluation. Given issues concerning corrosion, plugging and high operating cost, a combined supercritical water gasification and catalytic hydrothermal gasification concept is proposed as a practical strategy to directly harness hydrogen from sewage sludge in future applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The TG and DTA results were discussed in argon, oxygen, steam and steam blended gas atmospheres. Different stages of pyrolysis, combustion and gasification of the samples have been examined. It was shown that the combustion and gasification of char were occurred in two different temperature zones. The DTA-MS profile of the sample gives information on combustion and gasification process of the samples (ignition, peak combustion and burnout temperatures) and gases released (H2, O2, CO and CO2). The results showed that the different processes were mainly dependent on temperature. The evolution of the gas species was consistent with the weight loss of the samples during pyrolysis, combustion and gasification process. The effect of the ambiences during pyrolysis, combustion and gasification of the samples were reported. The appropriate temperature range to the sludge and miscanthus gasification was evaluated.

	abstract = {For a sustainable municipal sewage sludge management, not only the available technology, but also other parameters, such as policy regulations and socio-economic issues should be taken in account. In this study, the current status of both European and Greek Legislation on waste management, with a special insight in municipal sewage sludge, is presented. A SWOT analysis was further developed for comparison of pyrolysis with incineration and gasification and results are presented. Pyrolysis seems to be the optimal thermochemical treatment option compared to incineration and gasification. Sewage sludge pyrolysis is favorable for energy savings, material recovery and high added materials production, providing a 'zero waste' solution. Finally, identification of challenges and barriers for sewage sludge pyrolysis deployment in Greece was investigated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the sector of waste-to-energy looking at the main processes and feedstock involved. Within this, incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion and hydrothermal liquefaction are named and discussed. Through the discussions and scrutiny, manure is highlighted as a significant source of ammonia, methane, and nitrogen oxides emission, estimated to be 40\%, 22.5\% and 28\% respectively of the total UK's anthropogenic emissions. Manure, and indeed the pollution it poses, are shown to remain largely ignored. In waste to energy processing, manure is capable of providing biogas for a number of pathways including electricity generation. Anaerobic digestion is highlighted as a suitable process with the crucial capability of drastically reducing the pollution potential of manure and slurry compared to no processing, with up to 90\% reduction in methane and 50\% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions. If the majority of the 90 million tonnes of manure and slurry in the UK were to be processed through biogas harvesting, this could have the potential of producing more than 1.615 TWh of electricity. As such, the economics and legislation surrounding the implementation of anaerobic digestion for manure and slurry are discussed. In the end, restraining factors that limit the implementation of anaerobic digesters on farms in the UK are discussed. These are found to be mainly capital costs, lack of grants, insufficiently high tariff systems, rather than low gas yields from manure and slurry.},

Results showed that degradation behaviours and products released from sludge varied according to both operating conditions applied and characteristics of sludge. During pyrolysis, various components in sludge were degraded at different temperature regions with varying reactivity and products evolution therefore causing apparent activation energy, E and volatile compounds released dependence on temperature and conversion degree.

Considering the increase in the production and consumption of emerging contaminants, such as drugs, personal care products, and plasticisers, it is necessary to conduct studies that support the elaboration of laws and regulations that promote the environmentally sustainable use of sludge and effluents. In this work, the biological degradation of amoxicillin was studied under two anaerobic conditions: i) using a 6 L reactor operated under semi-continuous flow; and ii) a batch system with 100 mL sealed glass syringes. According to the statistical analysis, amoxicillin was completely removed from the systems, but biogas production inhibition was observed (p \&lt; 0.05). Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis identified amoxicillin penicilloic acid, amoxilloic acid, amoxicillin diketopiperazine and phenol hydroxypyrazine as by-products under anaerobic conditions.

The main biodegradable components of straw are cellulose and hemicellulose. Because of the different chemical structures and physicochemical properties, the performance of AD of cellulose and hemicellulose is different, thus it's also different from that of straw. Research on the similarities and differences of AD of straw, cellulose and hemicellulose is helpful to clarify the law of anaerobic digestion of straw and provide theoretical basis for further improving the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. However, there are very few studies on AD using cellulose and hemicellulose as raw materials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h2{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Rice straw (RS), cellulose, and hemicellulose were used as raw materials to study biogas production performance and changes in the volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Further, microbial communities and genetic functions were analyzed separately for each material. The biogas production potential of RS, cellulose, and hemicellulose was different, with cumulative biogas production of 620.64, 412.50, and 283.75 mL/g·VS$^{\textrm{− 1}}$, respectively. The methane content of the biogas produced from cellulose and hemicellulose was approximately 10\% higher than that produced from RS after the methane content stabilized. Biogas production and the methane content of RS stabilized more quickly than that of cellulose and hemicellulose. The accumulation of VFAs occurred in the early stage of anaerobic digestion in all the three materials, and the main volatile fatty acid component of RS was acetic acid, whereas that of cellulose and hemicellulose was propionic acid. The cumulative amount of VFAs in both cellulose and hemicellulose was relatively higher than that in RS, and the accumulation time was 12 and 14 days longer, respectively. When anaerobic digestion progressed to a stable stage, {\textless}em{\textgreater}Clostridium{\textless}/em{\textgreater} was the dominant bacterial genus in all three AD systems, and the abundance of {\textless}em{\textgreater}Ruminofilibacter{\textless}/em{\textgreater} was higher during anaerobic digestion of RS.

Digestate treatment is the physical, chemical or biological treatment and recirculation AD of the effluents of the anaerobic digesters (i.e., digestate) to the digester as supplementary feed to increase their utilization potential for energy conversion or green chemical production in post-valorization pathways. In this scope, semi-continuous small pilot scale manure digesters were operated in parallel with various operational settings. One of the digesters was fed by adding disintegrated digestate to an equal volume of fresh manure feed (recycle ratio of 1). The obtained results showed that US-assisted digestate treatment at 1500 kJ/kg TS specific energy input with 30 days of hydraulic retention time increased the methane production rate by 18\%. The increased methane production rate was found to be related to the applied specific energy and organic loading rate. A basic cost-benefit analysis showed that the energy demand of the US disintegration at lab scale was higher than the energy that can be recovered from the additional biogas produced.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Biowaste material is a good candidate for the production of energy in urban territories. The presence of undesirable or constituents mixed with the biowaste collected by municipalities makes it difficult to recycle organic matter of sufficient quality for agricultural uses. Methane production is particularly attractive for energy recovery notably because this energy vector can be distributed using the grid already in place for natural gas in many cities. Depending on the origin and biochemical composition of biowaste, methane can be produced using thermochemical (gasification then syngas methanation) or biological processes (anaerobic digestion). The objective of this work was to characterize the ability of biowaste to be used as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion. Based on considerations such as the quantities produced and the availability, four categories of biowaste produced in the city of Lyon were identified as potential key resources: Garden biowaste (GBW), restauration biowaste (RBW), household biowaste (HBW) and supermarkets biowaste (SMBW). Representative samples were taken from the sites of production and analyzed for parameters including biomethane potential (BMP). Each sample was then fractioned by leaching and the distribution of the BMP between the particulate fraction and the readily soluble fraction was assessed. GBW organic matter exhibited high hemicellulose content (over 81\% of VS) and a low BMP which was very poorly distributed into its soluble fraction (2 NL·kg$_{\textrm{TS}}$$^{\textrm{−1}}$). RBW, HBW and SMBW showed a much higher BMP with a strong distribution in the soluble fraction (100 NL·kg$_{\textrm{TS}}$$^{\textrm{−1}}$). Plastic materials were found to account for up to 40\% of the mass of SMBW sample. Altogether, GBW was identified as non-favorable for anaerobic digestion and recommended rather for thermochemical conversion. HBW, RBW and SMBW revealed adapted to anaerobic. Pulping was shown to be applicable in order to convert the 3 biowaste materials into a pumpable slurry with high biomethane potential.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were employed to compare mesophilic and thermophilic propionate degradation communities. Mesophilic propionate degradation involved multiple syntrophic organisms (\textit{Syntrophobacter}, \textit{Smithella}, and \textit{Syntrophomonas}), pathways, interactions, and preference toward formate-based electron transfer to methanogenic partners (i.e., \textit{Methanoculleus}). In thermophilic propionate degradation, one syntrophic organism predominated (\textit{Pelotomaculum}), interspecies H$_{\textrm{2}}$ transfer played a major role, and phylogenetically and metabolically diverse H$_{\textrm{2}}$-oxidizing methanogens were present (i.e., \textit{Methanoculleus}, \textit{Methanothermobacter}, and \textit{Methanomassiliicoccus}).

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Anaerobic digestion (AD) reduces GHG emission and facilitates renewable energy generation. The slow rate of adoption of this technology is often attributed to economic and technical considerations. Collaboration of two or more dairy farms into a centralized AD system can improve the process economics through economies of scale. However, uncertainties related to the process parameters and the scope/scale of the collaborative implementation impede its adoption. This study presents techno-economic optimization model as a design aid to determine ideal location, capacity, and participation level (cluster size) that maximize economic return on a cooperative digester. This study employs a probabilistic approach to overcome uncertainty regarding project parameters such as manure biomethane potential (BMP), project capital, and electricity sale price. Two case studies based on dairy production regions in Wisconsin were developed to test the model and demonstrate its capabilities. Herd sizes and spatial distribution in a given region were found to be critical factors in determining the viability of digestion projects in general, and collaborative digestion systems in particular. The number of simulation runs needed to capture the probability of profitable AD facility establishment was less than 1000 for both case studies assessed. Electricity sale price and biomethane potential of feedstock utilized were found to be the most restrictive to the feasibility of AD adoption. Changing the optimization objective function, to adopting maximization, favored the formation of collaborative AD facilities for both case studies evaluated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Untreated two-stage anaerobic digestion (thermophilic followed by mesophilic) achieved 76.4 ml/gTCOD methane yield compared to 40.4 ml/gTCOD achieved through conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion, with an increase in methane percentage. Application of hybrid (MW-H$_{\textrm{2}}$O$_{\textrm{2}}$) sludge pretreatment in the two-stage digestion enhanced initial sludge hydrolysis/solubilisation and consequently achieved 143.4 ml/gTCOD methane yield. Also, the highest methane percentage of 71\% was achieved during peak methanogenesis stage in this process. The synergetic effects of hybrid pretreatment were also confirmed by the higher release of extracellular polymeric substances. Oxidative stress exerted by the pretreatment resulted in the accumulation of superoxide radicals in the initial thermophilic phase; followed by increased sludge activity and biomethanation in the later phase of two-stage digestion. Hybrid feed sludge pretreatment in the two-stage system achieved a 73\% volatile solids reduction and more than 90\% reduction of faecal coliform. The various kinetic model parameters were determined by the application of the modified Gompertz model. These results illustrate that a novel semi-continuous two-stage anaerobic digester with hybrid feed sludge pretreatment improved sludge hydrolysis, sludge solubilisation, biogas production, sludge stabilization and reduces sludge retention time, and also achieves "class-A" biosolids by significant pathogen destruction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, it is cost-prohibitive to transport digestate to crop production areas further from digesters due to high water content. We evaluated the potential to recover phosphorus (P), as well as nitrogen (N) and potassium (K), from dairy manure digestate using dissolved air flotation (DAF) to separate fine solids. We measured flow rates and collected influent and effluent samples on 45 dates spanning 3.5 months from a DAF system fed by the post-screw press digestate on a Vermont dairy farm. Separated fine solids recovered during the initiation period contained 29 ± 3\% of N, 71 ± 18\% of P, and 11 ± 2\% of K from the influent. At full operational capability, the DAF system captured 36 ± 2\% of N, 85 ± 12\% of P, and 11 ± 1\% of K from the influent in the separated fine solids. These findings indicate that most P remaining in the post-screw press dairy manure digestate can be recovered using DAF, while remaining effluent has an expanded range of use options due to a 3-fold increase in the N:P ratio.},

This study evaluated the photoreactor efficiency of purple phototropic bacteria anaerobic membrane bioreactor (PAnMBR) at low irradiance for the treatment of municipal wastewater. Infrared irradiance levels of 3.0 and 1.4 W/m$^{\textrm{2}}$ produced by an infrared (IR) lamp emitting in the 800–900 nm wavelength range were investigated, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the irradiance energy demand. Experimental and modeling results demonstrated the ability of PPB to grow and treat raw municipal wastewater at the applied low irradiances, with effluent quality below target limits of TCOD˂50 mg/L, TN˂10 mg/L, and TP˂1 mg/L. While Monod kinetic parameters, k$_{\textrm{m}}$ and Y, were determined to be lower than previous high-energy studies (1.9 mgCOD/mgVSS-d and 0.38 mgVSS/mgCOD, respectively), the photobioreactor performance were consistently maintained, indicating that energy cost associated with IR illumination can be reduced by up to 97\%. To determine whether the treatment process could approach energy neutrality, subsequent anaerobic digestion experiments of the residual PPB biomass proved a potential for biogas recovery of up to 240 NmLCH$_{\textrm{4}}$/gVSS$_{\textrm{added}}$, and a moderate biomass biodegradability of 41\%. As a result, the net energy consumption of the process was estimated at 0.5 kWh/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ of treated municipal wastewater, considering an energy demand for illumination of 0.67 kWh/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ and an energy recovery attributed to the anaerobic digestion of 0.17 kWh/m$^{\textrm{3}}$ from the excess PPB biomass wasted from PAnMBR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Chain elongation is emerging as a bioprocess to produce valuable medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA; 6 to 8 carbons in length) from organic waste streams by harnessing the metabolism of anaerobic microbiomes. Although our understanding of chain elongation physiology is still evolving, the reverse β-oxidation pathway has been identified as a key metabolic function to elongate the intermediate products of fermentation to MCFA. Here, we describe two uncultured chain-elongating microorganisms that were enriched in an anaerobic microbiome transforming the residues from a lignocellulosic biorefining process. Based on a multi-omic analysis, we describe "{\textless}em{\textgreater}Candidatus{\textless}/em{\textgreater} Weimeria bifida" gen. nov., sp. nov., and "{\textless}em{\textgreater}Candidatus{\textless}/em{\textgreater} Pseudoramibacter fermentans" sp. nov., both predicted to produce MCFA but using different substrates. The analysis of a time series metatranscriptomic data set suggests that "{\textless}em{\textgreater}Ca{\textless}/em{\textgreater}. Weimeria bifida" is an effective xylose utilizer since both the pentose phosphate pathway and the bifid shunt are active. Furthermore, the metatranscriptomic data suggest that energy conservation during MCFA production in this organism is essential and occurs via the creation of an ion motive force using both the RNF complex and an energy-conserving hydrogenase. For "{\textless}em{\textgreater}Ca{\textless}/em{\textgreater}. Pseudoramibacter fermentans," predicted to produce MCFA from lactate, the metatranscriptomic analysis reveals the activity of an electron-confurcating lactate dehydrogenase, energy conservation via the RNF complex, H$_{\textrm{2}}$ production for redox balance, and glycerol utilization. A thermodynamic analysis also suggests the possibility of glycerol being a substrate for MCFA production by "{\textless}em{\textgreater}Ca{\textless}/em{\textgreater}. Pseudoramibacter fermentans." In total, this work reveals unknown characteristics of MCFA production in two novel organisms.

We analyzed MCFA production by two uncultured organisms that were identified as the main MCFA producers in a microbial community enriched from an anaerobic digester; this characterization, which is based on meta-multi-omic analysis, complements the knowledge that has been acquired from pure-culture studies.

Red-shifted fluorescence of leachates decayed by day 45 in aerobic biosolids-soil incubations, suggesting that larger, complex carbon sources liberated during solids stabilization may decompose readily in soils. Overall, other variables (source material, AD operation) may have a greater influence on final nutrient releases and organic matter quality than full-scale pretreatments to AD alone.

These results show that marine sediments can be effective inoculum for seaweeds digestion. Phylogenetic analyses of the methanogenic community in both sources of inoculum showed that the methanogen community within the sediment and sludge seeded cultures were different.

For instance, members of the genus {\textless}em{\textgreater}Methanosaeta{\textless}/em{\textgreater} which, dominated sludge seeded cultures were not detected in the sediment seeded cultures.

Performance of AD was assessed by measuring pH, VFA, biogas production and by modelling the kinetics of methane production using modified Gompertz equation. A statistical analysis of variance showed that AD leachate recirculation condition was the most impacting parameter on methane production. A high production of VFA was noticed ({\textasciitilde} 25 gDCO·L$^{\textrm{−1}}$) that did not lead to inhibition due to high buffer capacity of inoculum (5.2 gN-NH{\textless}span class="Stack"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}$$^{\textrm{+}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}·L$^{\textrm{−1}}$). 80\% of the biomethane potential was reached in the batch test with a daily leachate recirculation and with FW without paper.

A lower frequency of leachate recirculation or the addition of paper decreased methane production.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The syngas biomethanation process is a promising bioconversion route due to its high versatility, as it could be applied as a stand-alone technology, coupled to gasification plants, and integrated in anaerobic digestion or bioelectrochemical conversion systems. The biomethanation of syngas typically takes place through a rather complex network of interspecies metabolic interactions, which may vary significantly depending on the operating conditions applied and the diversity of microbial groups present. Despite there are several benefits derived from using microbial consortia, these also present challenges associated with limited process control and low product selectivity. To address the latter, the syngas biomethanation process carried out by mesophilic and thermophilic microbial consortia was modelled with the ultimate goal of studying possible catabolic route control strategies through the modulation of key operating parameters. The results showed that the thermophilic microbial consortium presented much higher apparent specific methane productivity (18.8 mmol/g VSS/d) than the mesophilic (4.6 mmol/g VSS/d) at an initial P$_{\textrm{CO}}$ of 0.2 atm, and that the difference increased with increasing initial P$_{\textrm{CO}}$. This difference in productivity was found to derive from the catabolic routes used rather than the kinetic parameters of each microbial consortium. Additionally, the thermodynamic considerations included in the models revealed the possibility of controlling the catabolic routes used by each consortium through the modulation of the mass transfer and P$_{\textrm{CO2}}$. Our results strongly indicate that modulating the P$_{\textrm{CO2}}$ is a promising operational strategy for boosting the product selectivity towards CH$_{\textrm{4}}$, the productivity of the system and the biomethane quality simultaneously.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although β-lactam residues are rarely detected in dairy manure, tetracycline residues are common and perhaps persistent. Generally, \&lt;15\% of bacterial pathogen dairy manure isolates are ARB, although resistance to some antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline) can be higher. Based on available data, the prevalence of medically important ARB on dairy operations is generally static or may be declining for antibiotic-resistant {\textless}em{\textgreater}Staphylococcus{\textless}/em{\textgreater} spp. Over 60 ARG can be found in dairy manure (including β-lactam and tetracycline resistance genes), although correlations with antibiotic usage, residues, and ARB have been inconsistent, possibly because of sampling and analytical limitations. Manure treatment systems have not been specifically designed to mitigate AR, though certain treatments have some capacity to do so. Generally, well-managed aerobic compost treatments reaching higher peak temperatures (\&gt;60°C) are more effective at mitigating antibiotic residues than static stockpiles, although this depends on the antibiotic residue and their interactions. Similarly, thermophilic anaerobic digesters operating under steady-state conditions may be more effective at mitigating antibiotic residues than mesophilic or irregularly operated digesters or anaerobic lagoons. The number of ARB may decline during composting and digestion or be enriched as the bacterial communities in these systems shift, affecting relative ARG abundance or acquire ARG during treatment. Antibiotic resistance genes often persist through these systems, although optimal management and higher operating temperature may facilitate their mitigation. Less is known about other manure treatments, although separation technologies may be unique in their ability to partition antibiotic residues based on sorption and solubility properties. Needed areas of study include determining natural levels of AR in dairy systems, standardizing and optimizing analytical techniques, and more studies of operating on-farm systems, so that treatment system performance and actual human health risks associated with levels of antibiotic residues, ARB, and ARG found in dairy manure can be accurately assessed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Human waste (HW) poses environmental and public health risk, thereby its sustainable management is becoming a serious growing challenge. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has long been introduced as an environmental-friendly and sustainable waste management technology with bio-methane as final product. Energy production via AD of HW would significantly contribute to low-carbon energy production systems and circular bio-economy. In this study, optimal conditions, inhibiting factors, and microbial community changes in continuously fed biogas reactors during anaerobic digestion of HW at elevated influent feedstock concentration (IFC) were investigated. The highest methane yield (327 ± 21 mL g VS$^{\textrm{−1}}$) was obtained at IFC of 3\% TS. Increased IFC deteriorated the process and affected the microbiome dynamicity. Specifically, methane production was reduced by 50\% with a concomitant increment of ammonia, Na$^{\textrm{+}}$, and K$^{\textrm{+}}$ concentration. Two archaeal species ({\textless}em{\textgreater}Methanosaeta{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and WSA2) were dominating the microbial community at stable period. Two uncharacterized microbial groups (WWE1 and WSA2) were present and a potential syntrophic interaction between these two members was hypothesized to play a crucial role in achieving a well-performing process. AD process treating HW showed promising results for valorization of HW to clean energy-biomethane both in environmental and economic aspects. Specifically, 1 t of HW VS could obtain a greenhouse gases (GHG) mitigation of −54 to −272 kg CO$_{\textrm{2,eq}}$ via the AD process. The LCA results demonstrated that such a bioenergy system would also bring about environmental savings in ecosystem quality and resource damage categories. Although ammonia inhibition at elevated IFC found as a potential inhibitory factor, it can be easily overcome using co-digestion strategies or nitrogen recovery at upstream.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study investigated the impact of co-digestion of cassava wastewater (CW) with livestock manure (poultry litter (PL) and dairy manure (DM)), and porous adsorbents (biochar (B-Char) and zeolite (ZEO)) on energy production and treatment efficiency. Batch anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted, with 16 treatments of CW combined with manure and/or porous adsorbents using triplicate reactors for 48 days. The results showed that CW combined with ZEO (3 g/g total solids (TS)) produced the highest cumulative CH4 (653 mL CH4/g VS), while CW:PL (1:1) produced the most CH4 on a mass basis (17.9 mL CH4/g substrate). The largest reduction in lag phase was observed in the mixture containing CW (1:1), PL (1:1), and B-Char (3 g/g TS), yielding 400 mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS) after 15 days of digestion, which was 84.8\% of the total cumulative CH4 from the 48-day trial. Co-digesting CW with ZEO, B-Char, or PL provided the necessary buffer needed for digestion of CW, which improved the process stability and resulted in a significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD). Co-digestion could provide a sustainable strategy for treating and valorizing CW. Scale-up calculations showed that a CW input of 1000–2000 L/d co-digested with PL (1:1) could produce 9403 m3 CH4/yr using a 50 m3 digester, equivalent to 373,327 MJ/yr or 24.9 tons of firewood/year. This system would have a profit of \$5642/yr and a \$47,805 net present value.},

An efficient transformation of substrate-bound carbon (C) to biogas during the anaerobic digestion process is one key aim for biogas plant operators. Therefore, many scientifically conducted experiments in lab-scale biogas reactors focused on maize silage degradations in order to analyze degradation efficiency. Commonly, degradation determination methods are based on volatile solids (VS), which serve as basis for specific biogas yield calculations. More detailed information on carbon degradation is gained by carbon mass quantification at start and end of the experiment. The carbon masses are used to determine gross carbon degradation of the substrate in anaerobic digestions (C deg$_{\textrm{gross}}$) (Bisutti et al. {\textless}span class="CitationRef"{\textgreater}{\textless}a href="\#CR7"{\textgreater}2004{\textless}/a{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}). Anaerobic digestion experiments are often performed in batch processes which, in the simplest case, are set up with one inoculum and one substrate (e.g. maize silage). Gross carbon degradation determination methods, however, offer no possibility to identify solely substrate-bound carbon degradation without taking carbon of the applied inoculum into account. Often indirect approaches are presented by analyzing carbon degradation in separately digested inoculum (control). Interactions between inocula and substrates are, however, neglected. To achieve a better understanding of the net degradation process, it is required to gain additional information about substrate degradation independently of the contributing inoculum.},

Physicochemical properties of biochars, biomethanization performance and microbial communities were examined to evaluate the effectiveness of biochars made from different plant wastes on AD in this study. Results showed that all biochars significantly reduce the lag phases during AD, compared with a control treatment (CK). Woody biochars particularly performed much better than herbal ones. Correlation analysis revealed that specific surface area (SSA) and electron donating capacity (EDC) were the key properties of the plant-feedstock-derived biochar in AD enhancement. Microbial community structure analysis showed that higher SSA and EDC are conducive for the growth of bacteria decomposing glucose, further promoting daily methane production in the early AD stage. The results indicate that it is important to select biochar with higher SSA and EDC to enhance biomethanization in AD systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As a consequence, the rate of waste generation and resultant pollution levels have risen drastically. Currently, most organic solid wastes are either land applied or sent to landfills, with the remaining fraction incinerated or anaerobically digested. However, with the current emphasis on the reduction of emissions, nutrient recovery, clean energy production and circular economy, it is important to revisit some of the conventional methods of treating these wastes and tap into their largely unrealized potential in terms of environmental and economic benefits. Wastewater sludge, with its high organic content and fairly constant supply, provides a great opportunity to implement some of these strategies using thermochemical conversion technologies, which are considered as one of the alternatives for upcycling such waste streams. This paper summarizes the results of prominent studies for valorizing wastewater sludge through thermochemical conversion technologies while drawing inferences and identifying relationships between different technical and operating parameters involved. This is followed by sections emphasizing the environmental and economic implications of these technologies, and their corresponding products in context of the broader fields of waste-to-energy, nutrient recycling and the progress towards a circular economy.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sewage sludge handling is becoming a concern in Europe due to its increasing amount and the presence of contaminants, such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Currently, over 70\% of sludge in Europe is treated thermally by incineration or used as fertilizer in agriculture. New thermochemical methods are under development and are expected to be implemented in the near future. This paper considers the life cycle environmental impacts of the following five alternatives for sludge handling, taking into account the presence of heavy metals and PPCPs: i) agricultural application of anaerobically digested sludge; ii) agricultural application of composted sludge; iii) incineration; iv) pyrolysis; and v) wet air oxidation. The results suggest that anaerobic digestion with recovery of nutrients and electricity has the lowest environmental impacts in 11 out of 18 categories considered. For the mean to maximum resource recovery, composting is the worst alternative, followed by pyrolysis with lower recovery rates. Agricultural application of anaerobically digested sludge has the highest freshwater ecotoxicity due to heavy metals, unless their concentration is in the lowest range, as found in some European sewage sludge applied on land. Therefore, stricter control of heavy metals in the sludge is needed for this option to limit freshwater ecotoxicity to the levels comparable with the thermal processes. The results also indicate that PPCPs have a negligible contribution to freshwater ecotoxicity when compared to heavy metals in the anaerobically digested sludge. Since thermal processes are currently drawing attention due to their potential benefits, the findings of this work suggest that their adoption is environmentally beneficial only if high resource recovery rates can be achieved.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Anammox, the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite, is a key microbial process in the nitrogen cycle. Under mesophilic conditions (below 40 °C), it is widely implemented to remove nitrogen from wastewaters lacking organic carbon. Despite evidence of the presence of anammox bacteria in high-temperature environments, reports on the cultivation of thermophilic anammox bacteria are limited to a short-term experiment of 2 weeks. This study showcases the adaptation of a mesophilic inoculum to thermophilic conditions, and its characterization. First, an attached growth technology was chosen to obtain the process. In an anoxic fixed-bed biofilm bioreactor (FBBR), a slow linear temperature increase from 38 to over 48 °C (0.05–0.07 °C d$^{\textrm{−1}}$) was imposed to the community over 220 days, after which the reactor was operated at 48 °C for over 200 days. Maximum total nitrogen removal rates reached up to 0.62 g N L$^{\textrm{−1}}$ d$^{\textrm{−1}}$. Given this promising performance, a suspended growth system was tested. The obtained enrichment culture served as inoculum for membrane bioreactors (MBR) operated at 50 °C, reaching a maximum total nitrogen removal rate of 1.7 g N L$^{\textrm{−1}}$ d$^{\textrm{−1}}$ after 35 days. The biomass in the MBR had a maximum specific anammox activity of 1.1 ± 0.1 g NH$_{\textrm{4}}$$^{\textrm{+}}$-N g$^{\textrm{−1}}$ VSS d$^{\textrm{−1}}$, and the growth rate was estimated at 0.075–0.19 d$^{\textrm{−1}}$.

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion producing biogas is an important decentralized renewable energy technology used to mitigate climate change. It is dependent on local and regional feedstocks, which determine its sustainability. This has led to discussions on how to alter feedstock for biogas plants without compromising their GHG (Greenhouse gas) saving, one particular issue being the use of Maize silage (MS) as the dominant feedstock. To support this discussion, this paper presents an integrated life cycle assessment of energy crop cultivation for 425 biogas catchments in the region of Central Germany (CG). The simulations for the CG region showed that MS as an effective crop to mitigate GHG emissions per kilowatt hour (GHGculti) was context dependent. In some cases, GHGculti reductions were supported due to higher yields, and in other cases, this led to increased GHGculti. We show that the often-proposed strategy of substituting one crop for another needs to be adapted for strategies which take into account the crop mixtures fed into biogas plants and how they perform altogether, under the specific regional and locational conditions. Only in this way can the trade-offs for lower GHGculti be identified and managed.},

	abstract = {Urban water systems and, in particular, wastewater treatment facilities are among the major energy consumers at municipal level worldwide. Estimates indicate that on average these facilities alone may require about 1\% to 3\% of the total electric energy output of a country, representing a significant fraction of municipal energy bills. Specific power consumption of state-of-the-art facilities should range between 20 and 45 kWh per population-equivalent served, per year, even though older plants may have even higher demands. This figure does not include wastewater conveyance (pumping) and residues post-processing. On the other hand, wastewater and its byproducts contain energy in different forms: chemical, thermal and potential. Until very recently, the only form of energy recovery from most facilities consisted of anaerobic post-digestion of process residuals (waste sludge), by which chemical energy methane is obtained as biogas, in amounts generally sufficient to cover about half of plant requirements. Implementation of new technologies may allow more efficient strategies of energy savings and recovery from sewage treatment. Besides wastewater valorization by exploitation of its chemical and thermal energy contents, closure of the wastewater cycle by recovery of the energy content of process residuals could allow significant additional energy recovery and increased greenhouse emissions abatement.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}With the constant increase in variable renewable energy production in electricity and district heating systems, integration with the gas system is a way to provide flexibility to the overall energy system. In the sustainable transition towards a zero-emission energy system, traditional natural gas can be substituted by renewable gasses derived from anaerobic digestion or thermal gasification and hydrogen. In this paper, we present a methodology for modelling renewable gas options and limits on biomass resources across sectors in the energy optimisation model, Balmorel. Different scenarios for socio-economic pathways to emission neutral electricity and district heating systems in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany, show that a renewable based energy system benefits from a certain percentage of gas as a supplement to other flexibility options like interconnectors. Especially upgraded biogas from anaerobic digestion serves as a substitute for natural gas in all scenarios. Allocating only 10\% of available biomass to the electricity and district heating sector leads to full exploitation of the scarce biomass resource by boosting biogas and syngas with hydrogen. The need for renewable gasses is highest in Germany and least in Norway, where hydro-power provides flexibility in terms of storable and dispatchable electricity production. The scenarios show that a required "late sprint" from fossils to achieve a zero-emission energy system in 2050 causes (1) significant higher accumulated emissions, and (2) a system, which strongly relies on fuels, also in an emission free system, instead of stronger integration of the electricity and district heating systems through electrification as well as stronger integration of the power systems across countries through interconnectors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Conductive materials are known to promote direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) by electrically bridging microbial cells. Previous studies have suggested that supplementation of graphene oxide (GO) based materials, including GO, and reduced GO (rGO), to anaerobic microbial communities, can promote DIET. This promotion mechanism is thought to be involved in electron transfer via rGO or biologically formed rGO. However, concrete evidence that rGO directly promotes DIET is still lacking. Furthermore, the effects of the physicochemical properties of GO-based materials on DIET efficiency have not been elucidated. In the current work, we investigated whether chemically and biologically reduced GO compounds can promote DIET in a defined model coculture system, and also examined the effects of surface properties on DIET-promoting efficiency. Supplementation of GO to a defined DIET coculture composed of an ethanol-oxidizing electron producer \textit{Geobacter metallireducens} and a methane-producing electron consumer \textit{Methanosarcina barkeri} promoted methane production from ethanol. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that GO was reduced to rGO during cultivation by \textit{G. metallireducens} activity. The stoichiometry of methane production from ethanol and the isotope labeling experiments clearly showed that biologically reduced GO induced DIET-mediated syntrophic methanogenesis. We also assessed the DIET-promoting efficiency of chemically reduced GO and its derivatives, including hydrophilic amine-functionalized rGO (rGO-NH$_{\textrm{2}}$) and hydrophobic octadecylamine-functionalized rGO (rGO-ODA). While all tested rGO derivatives induced DIET, the rGO derivatives with higher hydrophilicity showed higher DIET-promoting efficiency. Optical microscope observation revealed that microbial cells, in particular, \textit{G. metallireducens}, more quickly adhered to more hydrophilic GO-based materials. The superior ability to recruit microbial cells is a critical feature of the higher DIET-promoting efficiency of the hydrophilic materials. This study demonstrates that biologically and chemically reduced GO can promote DIET-mediated syntrophic methanogenesis. Our results also suggested that the surface hydrophilicity (i.e., affinity toward microbial cells) is one of the important determinants of the DIET-promoting efficiencies. These observations will provide useful guidance for the selection of conductive particles for the improvement of methanogenesis in anaerobic digesters.},

For that purpose, the effect of different fermentation conditions was examined, such as incubation temperature, nitrogen source and concentration, the addition of chemical modulators, as well as the feeding composition. The volatile fatty acid content of the effluent was totally depleted in a fed-batch culture of the microalga, while the cells accumulated DHA in a percentage of 35.6\% of total lipids, when fed with yeast extract or 34.2\% when fed with ammonium sulfate. Taking into consideration the economic feasibility of the culture conditions proposed it was concluded that the use of yeast extract could be substituted by the much economic ammonium sulfate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The objective of this study is to apply machine learning models to accurately predict daily biomethane production in an industrial-scale co-digestion facility. The methodology involved applying elasticnet, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting to input-output data from an industrial-scale anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) facility. The models were used to predict biomethane for 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 40-day time horizons. These models were fit on four years of operational data. The results showed that elastic net (a model with assumptions of linearity) was clearly outperformed by random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which had out-of-sample R$^{\textrm{2}}$ values ranging between 0.80 to 0.88, depending on the time horizon. In addition, feature importance and partial dependence analysis demonstrated the marginal and interaction effects on biomethane of selected biowaste inputs. For instance, food waste co-digested with percolate were shown to have strong positive interaction effects. One implication of this study is that XGBoost and random forest algorithms applied to industrial-scale ACoD data provide dependable prediction results and may be a useful complement for experimental and mechanistic/theoretical models of anaerobic digestion, especially where detailed substrate characterization is difficult. However, these models have limitations, and suggestions for deriving additional value from these methods are proposed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Co-harvest of cover crops and straw and storage as silage blends prior to biogas is promising as it could enhance the long-term storability and lead to synergies for anaerobic digestion. However, it is necessary to evaluate the feasibility of using co-ensiled blends and process optimization based on continuous test. In this study, semi-continuous thermophilic anaerobic digestion experiments were carried out with feeding of cover crop silage, co-ensiled cover crop and straw (with mixing ratios in relation to various harvest strategies) with or without addition of cattle manure. The main objective is to determine the feasibility of aforementioned mixtures for biogas production and the influence on microbial community structures in response to various feeding compositions. Results demonstrated that cover crop (silage) is feasible for digestion alone or with addition of barley straw, cattle manure or both, while manure addition led to higher CH$_{\textrm{4}}$ yield/buffer capacity, and enhanced the volatile solids reduction. Microbial community compositions were found to have been affected by the feeding, while high straw addition led to a distinct community structure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Treatment and disposal of sewage sludge constitute one of the major problems of wastewater treatment plants due to high water content and more stringent environmental regulations. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) technology is accepted as a promising method for sustainable sludge disposal because of the elimination of need for costly water reduction and drying processes before disposal by conventional methods. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of temperature (450–650 °C), solid matter content (1–2\%) and catalyst addition (0.5–2\% KOH) on supercritical gasification of sewage sludge in a continuous-flow pilot scale tubular reactor. The results indicate that the gasification efficiency is generally temperature dependent. Furthermore, catalyst addition improves the gasification efficiency at high solids content. The produced gas contains 60\% of H2 and 22\% of CH4 at experimentally determined optimal conditions (650 °C, 2\% solid matter content, 2\% KOH). The resulting gas contains H2S and CO below detection limits and there is no need for additional treatment. Consequently, SCWG technology provides complete decomposition of organic matter in a short time, clean gas formation with higher energy content, and volumetric reduction compared to conventional methods.},

For a steel plant with an annual production of crude steel of 10 million tons in China, the total annual energy saving and GHG emission reduction achieved are 3.31∗10 5 tons of standard coal and 1.74∗10 6 tons of CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, respectively.},

Torrefaction and the use of additive can enhance this process. This study presents the results of the gasification of raw and mildly torrefied sewage sludge, as well as mildly torrefied sewage sludge with the addition of calcium carbonate. Overall, the torrefaction in mild conditions had little influence on the composition of the obtained gas. The influence was much more visible when 5\% of calcium carbonate was added. The additive caused the increased average concentration of CH4 and decreased average concentration of H2 in the producer gas. The use of additive also improved the kinetics of the gasification of torrefied sewage sludge. Moreover, the tar deposition diagram confirmed that the use of calcium carbonate enhanced the quality of the produced gas by decreasing the content of the compounds, with a melting point higher than 30 °C, thus minimizing the deposition problem.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge conversion through supercritical water gasification presents a viable pathway for waste management and power generation which would allow the waste treatment process to be incentivized economically rather than by policy aspiration. In this conceptual study, two system configurations were developed using Aspen Plus. In the first configuration, limitation on the preheating of dewatered sewage sludge was imposed to prevent biomass degradation and tar formation which may lead to plugging in heat exchanger. The second configuration processed sewage sludge and the constraints on feed preheating was not imposed due to the higher water content of feed stream. Supplementary liquid feedstock was used to achieve auto-thermal operation in the second configuration. The supplementary liquid feedstock considered in this study included (i) waste cooking oil, (ii) heavy oil and (iii) crude glycerol, which are underutilized commercially. Feed concentration required in order to operate the gasifier auto-thermally in the temperature range of 500–700 °C were analyzed using sewage sludge data from various sources. Feed concentration required for auto-thermal operation was found to be significantly dependent on the heating value of sewage sludge and minimal lower heating value of about 12.63 MJ kg−1 was recommended in the first configuration as mechanical dewatering in real operation may only thickened the sludge up to 25\% dry matter content. Higher system efficiency was achieved at higher gasifier temperature and feed concentration, up to the concentration that achieved auto-thermal operation. Further increment on feed concentration would reduce the system efficiency as the surplus syngas was not collected. The use of supplementary liquid fuel in the second configuration enabled the treatment of sewage sludge with lower energy content and more optimal feed preheating allowed the system to reach up to 21.9\% in energy efficiency, markedly higher than first configuration which achieved up to 18.8\%.},

	abstract = {Thermal conversion is an effective non-traditional method for sewage sludge disposal. Herein, the application of sorption-enhanced steam gasification to sewage sludge treatment is experimentally investigated to generate hydrogen-rich syngas in a fixed bed setup. The main aim was to determine the optimal conditions and suitable sorbents for this process. CaO was selected as the sorbent, and different CaO sorbents were prepared via the sol-gel method. Al2O3, La2O3, and ZrO2 were used as support materials for CaO to enhance the sorbent activity and stability. The CO2 capture capacities and stabilities of the sorbents over multiple cycles were examined. Additionally, different metal additives including CoO, MgO, and CeO2 were combined with the sorbent to increase the hydrogen mole fraction and gas yield. The integration of the support material increased the stability of the sorbents over multiple cycles. High temperature increased the syngas yield and cold gas efficiency but decreased the hydrogen mole fraction. In comparison to CaO–La and CaO–Zr, CaO–Al afforded a higher hydrogen mole fraction and yield. Moreover, as Al2O3 is cheaper than La2O3 and ZrO2, it was selected as the most suitable support material for CaO, considering both its performance and cost. Transition metal Co was also investigated as a catalyst for gasification. A high Co loading ratio improved the hydrogen yield and cold gas efficiency but decreased the hydrogen mole fraction. These findings suggest that the CaO sorption-enhanced gasification to produce hydrogen-rich syngas is an appropriate method for sewage sludge disposal.},

The optimum preparation conditions included a CBSA/SS/GCFA ratio of 70:18:12, preheating at 480 °C, and sintering at 1060 °C for 15 min. The basic and environmental characteristics of the novel ceramsite meet specific standards requirements. The removal rate could reach 99.9\% under optimum conditions in a high-concentration solution, and the novel ceramsite could be reused 6 times and maintain in high remove rate. The adsorption mechanism was determined to be as follows: (1) Ceramsite features a mesoporous structure with an abundance of pores on which cationic exchange could occur. (2) Pb (II) enters the pores of the adsorbent and are attracted by anionic groups to deposit on the surface of ceramsite. (3) A large amount of Pb (II) bonds with Si[sbnd]O or Al[sbnd]O[sbnd]Si[sbnd]O to embed in the matrix frame of the adsorbent; the rest of the metal forms precipitates on the frame layer or [PO4].},

The results showed that the addition of sludge changed CSS from the dilatant fluid to the yield pseudo-plastic fluid. The stability of CSS was observed increasing, while the preparation concentration was decreased at the same viscosity requirement. A combination of BET analysis and EDLVO theory calculation was carried out to study the behavior among particles and water in CSS. Sludge could attract considerable water, increasing the viscosity of slurry. Besides, sludge might connect with coal particles to structure a three-dimensional network which would be destroyed by agitation and then released trapped water, resulting in the pseudo-plasticity of CSS. The network could also prevent the aggregation of particles and improve the stability of slurry.},

	abstract = {Torrefaction of sewage sludge, a by-product from waste water treatment plants, has been receiving increased attentions in terms of sustainable sludge treatment, energy recovery and possibility to mitigate the environmental impacts. Torrefied sewage sludge is recognized as a better solid fuel than the dry sewage sludge, and it is also beneficial for subsequent thermochemical processes. In this study, sewage sludge was subjected to different torrefaction conditions in a thermogravimetric analyzer. The thermogravimetric data were then simulated using a two-consecutive reaction model to reproduce the mass losses during torrefaction. The obtained results from the torrefaction of the non-lignocellulosic biomass are also compared with other lignocellulosic biomass including a softwood and a hardwood. The findings from this study reveal that the non-lignocellulosic biomass is less thermally resistant and degrades much faster than the lignocellulosic biomass during the first stage of torrefaction. Moreover, the solid yield from the sewage sludge torrefaction at temperatures less than 280 °C is lower than that from the woody biomass torrefaction. However, this trend is inverted when the torrefaction temperature attains 280 °C and higher. The results obtained are useful for new design or retrofit of the sewage sludge torrefaction processes.},

Numerical simulations were performed in order to assess the effect of temperature, pressure and biomass-to-water ratio on gas-phase yield and composition. A partial energy integration was also discussed, by considering the energy recovery from a turbine expansion of the gas-phase stream leaving the gasifier. The proposed thermodynamic approach allows predicting not only gasification efficiency of gasifier but also energy balance on the entire gasification process. Results showed that the dry substrates (almond shells and algae more than digestate and sludge) tend to form more carbon monoxide. Besides, data comparison revealed that the produced hydrogen comes from biomass and water for high process temperature, while when temperature decreases, the thermodynamic path tends to promote water formation from the hydrogen of the dry biomass.},

The process included a super- or sub-critical reaction, BHO recovery via a condenser and centrifuge, BHO purification via extraction, phase separation and filtration, hydrotreating desulfurization, and wastewater treatment. For techno-economic analysis (TEA), two cases were considered: BHO production with supercritical (Case 1) and subcritical (Case 2) water. The four-level economic potential approach was used for the TEA. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of the BHO plants was approximately 0.91 \$/L, which was higher than the actual selling price of 0.55 \$/L. Case 2 showed higher economic values than Case 1 owing to the lower capital and production costs. When the SS treatment credit is {\textgreater} 120 \$/t or the BHO price is higher than the MFSP, the BHO plant with subcritical water (Case 2) is profitable.

To further evaluate the utilization value of char/tar or to give a reasonable strategy for char/tar inhibition, the char/tar was characterized by elemental analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermosgravimetric analyzer, scanning electron microscope, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The char/tar arising from the different model compounds exhibit differences in properties such as calorific value, thermal stability, and surface structure, which were due to the different pathways involved in their formation.

	abstract = {Considering changes in the global climate, there is an impetus to diversify away from fossil fuels as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass, as a source of energy, has the potential to generate sustainable power and fuels and contribute towards a cleaner future. In fact, the utilisation of biomass as a carbon dioxide neutral organic source in an integrated system generates valuable products, and reduces waste and the consumption of non-renewable resources. Gasification, the preferred option for converting biomass to combustible gas, provides higher electrical efficiencies than combustion, whereby the syngas generated from the gasification process can be utilised to generate clean energy. In addition, syngas can be utilised for the production of ammonia and methanol thus reducing their respective dependencies on natural gas. This study will detail an optimised biomass gasification process considering multiple parameters, including the thermodynamic operating conditions, the type of gasifier (gasifying agent) and feedstock. Fundamentally, this study considers the process pathways for the recycling of multiple sources of biomass to generate high energy syngas from the available biomass options when used in combination as blends or individually. To achieve this aim, an Aspen Plus simulation model is developed for four different biomass agent-based gasification techniques using the biomass characteristics of certain Qatar biomass materials, which include date pits, manure and sewage sludge. Outcomes of the study included an optimisation of the gasification processes to yield different blending options of the biomass feedstock satisfying the downstream operations of power and fuels production. The results demonstrate the domination of date pits for two of the considered configurations with over 99\% w/w date pit feed composition. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis conducted on the different configurations highlighted specific optimum operation points in terms of temperature, pressure, and oxygen and steam feed ratios. The hydrogen content in the generated syngas, considered important for the downstream production, yields a peak at approximately 850 °C and 1 bar with a modified equivalence ratio of approximately 2.5, and a ratio of oxygen supplied by an air-steam combination of approximately 0.6. The process can be further optimised by considering trade-offs between product purity or yield, profit, operating efficiency, quality of raw materials blends, and carbon footprint.},

Two model gases consisting of O2/CO2/N2 and O2/CO2/H2O/N2 were used as gasifying agents. Under O2/CO2/N2 atmosphere, the lower heating values (LHV) of produced gas were in a range of 3.07–3.79 MJ/Nm3, and cold gas efficiency (CGE) were in a range of 47–66\%. When steam was introduced into the gasification atmosphere, the efficiency of the process significantly improved. LHV of the produced gas under O2/CO2/H2O/N2 atmosphere was in a range of 6.48–7.18 MJ/Nm3, and CGE was in a range of 73–88\%. K2CO3 had an obvious catalytic effect on sludge gasification process. Additionally, K2CO3 had stronger catalytic effect under steam-free atmosphere and it was better in promoting CO generation when compared with BA. BA exhibited the ability to increase gas yield under steam-free atmosphere, while it only had a slight effect under steam-containing atmosphere. Based on continuous monitoring of gas during gasification process, LHV of the produced gas could be increased by nearly twofold, possibly up to 11.96 MJ/Nm3, by controlling the proper reaction time (10–12 min) to prevent the dilution effect from excessive gasifying agents.},

The conversion efficiency ranged from 19 to 100\% and it depended on the specific energy input (SEI), gas flow rate, initial tar concentration, and the nature of the tars compounds. Generally, it was shown that the conversion rate increased with the SEI and that the aliphatic, cyclic and substituted compounds were converted much easier than benzene. Moreover, applying plasma led to the production of heavier aromatics (i.e. naphthalene, indene, acenaphthylene) but the rise in their concentration was significantly smaller than the amount of converted compounds. The gas composition changes revealed in the increase of H2 and CO concentration that was an effect of hydrocarbons and CO2 conversion. Additionally, it was indicated that the microwave plasma reactor’s performance was noticeably worse than in the case of the laboratory test with a simulated producer gas. This was mainly attributed to differences in the reactors’ geometry, lower hydrogen concentration and the presence of inorganic deposit on the reactor’s walls that might have inhibited microwaves transfer. In general, the microwave plasma technology seems promising in the context of cleaning and upgrading the producer gas, however, further optimization research is necessary to make it more reliable and less energy consuming.

The co-pyrolysis performances of digestate and lignite blended by dry process were better than that blended by wet process, while the wet-blending process could improve the performance in co-gasification stage because of the larger pore diameter and pore volume. When anaerobic digestion (AD) time was 40 days, the synergistic interaction between digestate and lignite were the most remarkable based on the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and the experiments in the lab-scale downdraft fixed bed gasifier.

However, technology selection is one of the greater challenges because it is not possible to implement a technology that covers all the requirements of the considered environments. Consequently, this paper shows an example of the utilization of an analytical hierarchy process, as a decision-making tool in terms of technology selection, for sewage sludge management in Rijeka, Croatia. The criteria structuring and evaluation process with the description of several possible alternatives for thermal treatment technologies are defined within this research. For the case of Rijeka, the best and most suitable technology for sewage sludge treatment is gasification, which coincides with the results obtained from the analysis of the literature review. According to the results in this paper, the possibilities of the use of this scientific method on the national level for the selection of sewage sludge treatment technology should be considered, due to the simplicity of its use and capability of its adaptation to various situations and areas.},

	abstract = {The necessity of recycling anthropogenically used phosphorus to prevent aquatic eutrophication and decrease the economic dependency on mined phosphate ores encouraged recent research to identify potential alternative resource pools. One of these resource pools is the ash derived from the thermochemical conversion of sewage sludge. This ash is rich in phosphorus, although most of it is chemically associated in a way where it is not plant available. The aim of this work was to identify the P recovery potential of ashes from sewage sludge co-conversion processes with two types of agricultural residues, namely wheat straw (rich in K and Si) and sunflower husks (rich in K), employing thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The results indicate that both the melting behavior and the formation of plant available phosphates can be enhanced by using these fuel blends in comparison with pure sewage sludge. This enhanced bioavailability of phosphates was mostly due to the predicted formation of K-bearing phosphates in the mixtures instead of Ca/Fe/Al phosphates in the pure sewage sludge ash. According to the calculations, gasification conditions could increase the degree of slag formation and enhance the volatilization of K in comparison with combustion conditions. Furthermore, the possibility of precipitating phosphates from ash melts could be shown. It is emphasized that the results of this theoretical study represent an idealized system since in practice, non-equilibrium influences such as kinetic limitations and formation of amorphous structures may be significant. However, applicability of thermodynamic calculations in the prediction of molten and solid phases may still guide experimental research to investigate the actual phosphate formation in the future.},

	abstract = {Because of the heterogeneity and high content of contaminant precursors (Cl, S and N), gasification of waste-derived fuels is challenging compared to clean biomass. A great deal of work has been published on thermal conversion of wastes. However, reliable quantification of pollutants (i.e. HCl, H2S, NH3 and HCN) during gasification of wastes remains a difficult task. Particularly, it is hard to scale-up results from laboratory-scale to industrial reactors, since the materials and methods used in the former result in a significant interference with the gasification process, whereas in the latter the interaction is very limited. In this paper, these issues are investigated by: (i) analyzing pilot/laboratory plant data from literature to calculate the recovery (ratio between the contaminant measured in the output streams and that in the input fuel); and (ii) conducting dedicated laboratory tests in various setups, doping a gas with the main inorganic contaminants in concentrations typical of waste-derived syngas. Outcomes from our tests are helpful to elucidate the inconsistencies detected when analyzing data from the literature. Recommendations for proper sampling and analysis of contaminants during the gasification of waste-derived fuels are given, so that the measurements from laboratory can be properly scaled up.

	abstract = {In the present study, a modified equilibrium model was developed by Aspen Plus to simulate the gasification of biosolids (treated sewage sludge) in an atmospheric fluidized bed reactor (FBR) using air as a gasification agent. The model, which is based on the Gibbs free energy minimization applying the restricted equilibrium method, was calibrated and validated against a set of experimental data obtained in a pre-pilot-scale FBR. The comparison between the simulation results and the experimental data showed satisfactory agreement, in particular, with respect to the content of combustible gases in the syngas and the heating value. The main objective of the work was to assess the impact of different sludge pretreatment methods (i.e., torrefaction, anaerobic digestion, carbonization, hydrothermal treatment, and copelletization of sewage sludge with solid fuels) and the key operating conditions (gasification temperature and equivalence ratio) on both the syngas quality (composition and heating value) and the performance of the gasifier in terms of the carbon conversion efficiency (CCE), syngas yield (YG), and cold gas efficiency (CGE) under the same operating conditions. Global sensitivity analysis was first performed by varying the gasification temperature and the equivalence ratio (ER). Then, the impact of sludge pretreatments was evaluated by changing the sludge composition in the model in line with experimental data from the pertinent literature. Results point out that the torrefaction pretreatment in combination with gasification exhibits promising results in terms of gas quality (i.e., higher H2/CO ratio and lower CO2/CO ratio) and LHV, even though the carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) slightly decreases presumably because of the lower volatile content in the torrefied material with respect to the parent one. ©},

Thus, it is important to establish the correlations between HTC treatment and subsequent pyrolysis/gasification of SS-derived hydrochars prepared at various HTC temperatures and HTC durations. The results showed that HTC treatment upgraded the fuel quality of SS and led to the evolution of aromatic structures. Such upgrading made SS-derived hydrochars toward the region of lignite in the Van Krevelen diagram. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that both pyrolysis and gasification reactivity had a generally negative correlation with HTC temperature. Regarding the role of HTC duration, the opposite trend was observed between pyrolysis and gasification reactivities. In general, not only the fuel properties but also the pyrolysis and gasification reactivity were dependent on HTC temperature more significantly than on HTC duration. These findings can provide an insight into thermochemical utilization of SS-derived hydrochars.},

A transient model coupling a two-phase fluidization model (in terms of reaction kinetics and hydrodynamics) and a solar cavity receiver model is established to conduct the parametric investigation of the proposed solar gasifier, including the effects of the direct normal irradiance, gasifying agent composition, and spatial flux distribution at the freeboard wall on the performance criteria of solar gasification i.e. solar upgraded ratio and solar-to-fuel efficiency.

Compared with the solid products from AP torrefaction, the GP torrefied sludge had higher ash content, lower H/C ratio and better hydrophobicity.

This study aimed to investigate the influence of EFB addition on the syngas production and its composition. The heavy metal distribution and the leaching potential of the solid residue were also assessed. The results showed that syngas yield significantly increased with the addition of EFB into the feedstock. The cold gas efficiency (CGE) and carbon efficiency (CE) of co-gasification were higher than those of individual gasification. The actual syngas production from co-gasification of sludge and EFB was 45\% higher than the theoretical total volume. The results indicated that the addition of EFB to sludge had the synergetic promotion effect on syngas production from sludge and EFB in supercritical water. This enhancement might be due to the dissolution of alkali metals from EFB and the adjustment of organic ratio. In addition, higher percentage of heavy metals were deposited and stabilized in the solid residue after SCWG. The leaching concentration of heavy metals from the solid residues was decreased to a level below the standard limit which enables it to be safely disposed of in landfill. In conclusion, the EFB addition has been proved to promote syngas production, as well as, stabilize the heavy metal in solid residues during co-SCWG.},

In order to reduce liquid residues released into the environment, this study investigated the reuse of liquid residues as feed water in subsequent SCWG. We also evaluated the effect of wastewater reuse on syngas production and fate of heavy metal. The experiment was performed in a 500-ml-capacity Hastelloy reactor at 400 °C and above 25 Mpa for 60 min with a 4:1 ratio of 10\% dry wt. of solid (mixture of sludge and empty fruit bunch) and 90\% wt. of liquid feed. The use of recycled liquid increased the concentration of K and Na in the solution from 26 mg/L and 91 mg/L to 49 mg/L and 290 mg/L, respectively. Subsequently, syngas production increased from 9.4 to 14.1 mol/kg organic matter. In addition, H2 production increased by 30\%. The increase in syngas generation could be attributed to the alkaline salts which act as homogenous catalysts and to the organic matter in the liquid residue. In addition, the total mass of As, Cr, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the liquid residues reduced from 57.36 to 47.34 µg. Thus, experimental results imply that the recycling of liquid residues in SCWG will not only improve the syngas production efficiency of the system, but also enable the accumulation of heavy metals in the solid residue to prevent pollution risk.},

	abstract = {Pyrolysis of anaerobically digested sludge can serve as an efficient biomass for biofuel production. Pyrolysis produces products like char, bio-oil, and combustible gases by thermochemical conversion process. It can be used for sludge treatment that decreases sludge disposal problems. Sludge produced from anaerobic co-digestion (microalgae, cow dung, and paper) waste has high carbon and hydrogen content. We investigated the candidacy of the anaerobic sludge having high heating value (HHV) of 20.53 MJ/kg as a reliable biomass for biofuels production. The process of pyrolysis was optimized with different temperatures (400, 500, and 600 ◦C) to produce high quantity and improved quality of the products, mainly bio-oil, char, and gas. The results revealed that with the increase in pyrolysis temperature the quantity of char decreased (81\% to 55\%), bio-oil increased (3\% to 7\%), and gas increased (2\% to 5\%). The HHV of char (19.2 MJ/kg), bio-oil (28.1 MJ/kg), and gas (18.1 MJ/kg) were predominantly affected by the amount of fixed carbon, hydrocarbons, and volatile substance, respectively. The study confirmed that the anaerobic sludge is a promising biomass for biofuel production and pyrolysis is an efficient method for its safe disposal.},

In this study, a greener alternative was studied for the removal and recovery of chromium from tannery sludge by ultrasound-assisted supercritical water oxidation approach. Supercritical water oxidation or ultrasonic treatment was respectively conducted to explore the detailed experiment parameters on organic destruction and chromium liberation. Ultrasound-assisted supercritical water oxidation treatment was then investigated to further explore the mechanism for Cr liberation. Experimental results indicate that supercritical water oxidation or ultrasonic treatment cannot effectively remove Cr from tannery sludge, while almost all Cr (99.6\%) will be liberated to supernatant at optimized experimental conditions by ultrasound-assisted supercritical water oxidation treatment, with TOC removal efficiency over 99.9\%. This indicates that toxic substances in sludge will be completely removed after ultrasound-assisted supercritical water oxidation treatment, and liberated Cr in the supernatant can be re-utilized after purification. This process is an efficient alternative for toxicity removal and chromium recovery from real tannery sludge contaminated by high concentration of Cr and refractory organics.},

In this work, three types of biowaste (i.e., lignocellulosic, non-lignocellulosic and ash-rich types) were selected for the HTC experiments, and the subsequent gasification of hydrochars was carried out to investigate its thermogravimetric curves and the properties of products (i.e., syngas, tar and biochar). The results found that HTC improves the gasification efficiency in terms of the syngas quality and the conversion degree of sample. The concentrations of H2 and CH4 in syngas were increased, while the gasified tar from hydrochars was concurrently reduced to half of its original value from biowastes under similar conditions. Furthermore, as HTC progressed, the gasification period and dynamic kinetics of samples exhibited slightly different, but the variation in the conversion process of gasification was similar; biowaste diversity in components is the reason for the former, while the developed aromatic structures in hydrochars is the explanation for the latter. These findings can not only provide a comprehensive knowledge on the gasification conversion of hydrochar, but also give a referential observation for designing, optimizing as well as scaling up the thermochemical conversion of industrial biowastes.},

	abstract = {The hydrothermal carbonization could improve the fuel quality of municipal solid waste (MSW), in terms of water content reduction, chlorine removal, and energy densification. The chlorine content plays a significant role in determining whether the derived hydrochar is suitable as a fuel or chemical product. Many works focus on the chlorine behavior and fuel quality of hydrochar. However, few works focus on the gasification characteristics of real MSW-derived hydrochar. In this work, the hydrochar derived from real MSW employing hydrothermal treatment were gasified under various temperatures (600–1000 °C) and atmospheres (Air, CO2/O2 and steam/O2), with gas and tar analyzed by GC and GC–MS, respectively. The results showed that the hydrothermal treatment could remove 90.5 \% chlorine of the MSW at an HTC temperature of 220 °C for 30 min. The syngas quality was improved whereas the tar yield was generally reduced with the reaction temperature, independent on the atmosphere. The H2, CO and CH4 yield was increased gradually, while the CO2 yields kept decreasing with the gasification temperature ranging from 600 to 900 °C. The highest H2 yield occured in the steam/O2 gasification, resulting in the highest H2/CO ratio of 4.58 at a gasification temperature of 1000 °C. The tar yield in the air gasification was the maximum, while it was the minimum in the steam/O2 gasification. The carbon conversion rate was increased with the gasification temperature. 900 ℃ was supposed to be a suitable operating window for obtaining gas with high H2 concentration and heating value. All these results indicated that the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) coupled with gasification was an effective approach to produce hydrogen-rich gas from MSW. And these findings might be helpful for the design and further optimization MSW thermochemical conversion process.},

These products were characterized in terms of EI/MS, FTIR, TGA and GC to understand their chemical composition, thermal decomposition, structural properties and high biofuel reactivity. Characterization results revealed that the dominant chemical components in the heavy bio-oil were esters (40.22\%), phenols (20.02\%), alcohols (10.16\%), organic acids (9.07\%), nitrogenous compounds (8.83\%) and ketones/aldehydes (6.42\%), while the light oil was rich with a higher fraction of phenols (54.13\%) and nitrogenous compounds (27.04\%). Particularly, bio-oils obtained from supercritical conditions contained increased phenolic compounds and reduced oxygenated chemicals such as alcohols, aliphatic acid, ketones and aldehydes, suggesting the improved quality of bio-oil due to the reduction in oxygen contents. Meanwhile, H2-rich syngas production with the H2 yield of 38.87\% was obtained at 535 °C for 20 min, and higher reaction temperature presented a positive influence on H2 production during Pteris vittata L. liquefaction. Moreover, the remaining biochar product was analyzed to determine whether it could be used as a direct solid fuel or auxiliary fuel.

However, substantial efforts are still required to make it a feasible and competitive technology for hydrogen production. Biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, so it is essential to understand their behavior in high-pressure systems in order to optimize hydrogen production. As the main component of biomass, cellulose has been extensively studied, and its decomposition has been carried out at both subcritical and supercritical conditions. Most previous works of this model compound were carried out in batch reactors, where reaction times normally take place in a few minutes. However, the present study demonstrates that gasification reactions can achieve efficiency levels of up to 100\% in less than ten seconds. The effect of temperature (450-560 °C), the amount of oxidant (from no addition of oxidant to an excess over stoichiometric of 10\%, n = 1.1), the initial concentration of organic matter (0.25-2 wt. \%) and the addition of a catalyst on the SCWG of cellulose in a continuous tubular reactor at short residence times (from 6 to 10 s) have been studied in this work.

	abstract = {A "cradle-to-grave" life cycle assessment is performed to identify the environmental issues of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) produced through a hybrid thermochemical-biological process using anaerobically digested sewage sludge (ADSS) as feedstock. The assessment includes a measure of the energy performance of the process. The system boundary includes: (i) Sludge pyrolysis followed by volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production; (ii) PHAs-enriched biomass production using a mixed microbial culture (MMC); (iii) PHAs extraction with dimethyl carbonate; and iv) PHAs end-of-life. Three scenarios differing in the use of the syngas produced by both pyrolysis and biochar gasification, and two more scenarios differing only in the external energy sources were evaluated. Results show a trade-off between environmental impacts at global scale, such as climate change and resources depletion, and those having an effect at the local/regional scale, such as acidification, eutrophication, and toxicity. Process configurations based only on the sludge-to-PHAs route require an external energy supply, which determines the highest impacts with respect to climate change, resources depletion, and water depletion. On the contrary, process configurations also integrating the sludge-to-energy route for self-sustainment imply more onsite sludge processing and combustion; this results in the highest values of eutrophication, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity. There is not a categorical winner among the investigated configurations; however, the use of a selected mix of external renewable sources while using sludge to produce PHAs only seems the best compromise. The results are comparable to those of both other PHAs production processes found in the literature and various fossil-based and bio-based polymers, in terms of both non-biogenic GHG emissions and energy demand. Further process advancements and technology improvement in high impact stages are required to make this PHAs production process a competitive candidate for the production of biopolymers on a wide scale.},

	abstract = {Circular management of carbon and nutrients is at the basis of future environmental sustainability and global food safety. However, direct resource recovery and upcycling from wastes pose safety concerns related to source contamination. By carefully evaluating the potential integrations of existing and emerging bio-technologies, we put forward new possible pathways for the clean-tech upcycling of recovered carbon and nutrients. By coupling anaerobic digestion and thermochemical gasification, the key process line converts biowastes to clean gaseous substrates (e.g. H2, CH4, CO2, CO, NH3, P2), useable for the fermentative production of safe single cell protein (SCP). The subsequent direct (aerobic) or two-stage (anaerobic/aerobic) SCP fermentation of energy-rich gases can produce protein-rich microbial biomass. Worldwide, this is estimated to generate up to 606 Mt SCP per year, with the protein content more than 3 times the worldwide annual soybean meal protein production. The combined SCP and biochar production can further capture and store up to 2.33 Gt CO2-eq per year, representing ∼50\% of the Paris Agreement target on annual carbon capture. Finally, this approach could recycle up to 18.5 Mt nitrogen per year (∼8\% of current N losses) and 6.5 Mt phosphorus per year (∼25\% of the annual phosphorus fertilizer production). In view of a low-carbon and sustainable circular bioeconomy, this concept presents high impact and positive implications, especially in terms of safe future feed and food supply. Producing SCP as a multi-applicable recovery product can be already carried out at production costs that are competitive with those of other feed additives, especially if the social cost of carbon emissions is considered.},

The results showed that char samples from co-pyroysis of SS and RS with the high ash content and low heating value were not suitable for fuel.

However, such units would, in many cases, have to work within one system with intermittent energy sources, thus having to cope with new requirements regarding flexibility. Tars are unwanted by-products of gasification, and their presence introduces additional operation and maintenance problems. The requirement for the low load operation could potentially exacerbate these problems. The aim of this work is the characterization of the tars from a novel, pilot scale, biomass gasifier, developed by the Energy Research Center of the Technical University of Ostrava, during the low load operation. The amount of GC detectable compounds, excluding benzene, reached approximately 6.2 g/m3 when working at the equivalence ratio of 0.06. Additionally, tar deposits from the gas cooler were analysed, showing that not all compounds classified as tars have a similar impact on the deposition. Recently developed concept of a tar deposition diagram was implemented, to account for a different propensity towards the formation of such deposits. The concept seems to be advantageous, in comparison to grouping the tars according to existing classification, based on the chemical structure.},

Additionally, the values of relative environmental, economic, and energy performance indicators were calculated for a group of biomass-containing fuel compositions. The calculation results for equal weight coefficients are presented. It was shown that the efficiency of slurry fuels with biomass is 10\%-24\% better than that of coal and 2\%-8\% better than that of filter-cake without additives.

High-fidelity process simulations are performed to derive the mass and energy balance.

Both pyrolysis technologies had 18\% to 56\% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than the other technologies. GHG balances showed trade-offs with economic performance. Sensitivity analysis identified carbon credits, products' market price, and plant capacity as the most influential factors. Building one centralized biorefinery in NYS especially for fast pyrolysis was more economically feasible than building multiple smaller biorefineries (biochar breakeven price of -\$128 to -\$91/ton vs \$74 to \$93/ton).

Optimum conditions were a charging rate of 50 to 60\% by volume (504.71 to 605.65 kg/Sm2) of feedstock in the gasifier, equivalence ratio of 0.21 to 0.33, and no oxygen enrichment.

Pollutants such as dust, tar, and gases, were analyzed at the outlet of the cleaning facility and gasifier, and their low concentrations in the producer gas were sufficient to allow for operation of the gas engine. The gasification process exhibited stable operation over 288 h, which included the facility check period. The average gasifier temperature was 825 °C, 17.14\% by volume of producer gas was syngas, and gas engine power generation was 235 kWh during this period; power consumption of the entire system was 68 kWh.

	abstract = {Co-pyrolysis is a promising approach to recover energy from sewage sludge (SS) and municipal solid waste (MSW). Hg emission during this process has serious environmental risks. To reduce the environmental impact, orthogonal experiments on the blending ratio, heating rate, pyrolysis temperature, and residence time were conducted during SS and MSW co-pyrolysis. Variance analysis was used to determine the influence and synergetic effects of these factors. Multivariate nonlinear, neural network, random forest, and support vector machine models were used to simulate the Hg distribution based on four parameters, which were later optimized to optimize the Hg fixing ratio in pyrolysis char. The Hg was mainly distributed in the pyrolysis gas and char. The variance analysis results indicate that the blending ratio is the key factor influencing Hg distribution, and there is little synergetic effect among the four factors. Further experiments showed that a blending ratio of 87.5 SS wt\% could enhance Hg fixation in char. The neural network model shows the best simulation performance with a mean relative error of 8.92\%. The optimal parameters are a heating rate of 7 °C/min, pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C, and residence time of 10 min, resulting in a Hg fixing ratio of 25.68 wt\% in pyrolysis char. The simulated Hg fixation characteristics correlate with the experimental results. This study provides insights into Hg distribution under various conditions during co-pyrolysis of SS and MSW. It is hoped that this work can contribute to the control of Hg during the waste treatment and utilization process.},

	abstract = {Biomass containing organic materials could come from a number of sources such as from agricultural residues, sustainable forests, waste food, and industry by-products. Also, being a renewable source of energy, it has the significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions releasing from the fossil fuel based technologies. Therefore, energy from biomass is becoming a favourable technology to convert solid fuel to valuable gas and one of the effective approaches is gasification. In this research, a three dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) steady-state thermochemical model is developed to simulate biomass (rubber wood) gasification in a downdraft gasifier. Simulated CFD model includes all the four zones (drying, pyrolysis, oxidation and reduction) of gasifer. For optimising the gasifier temperature and syngas composition, a sensitivity analysis of homogeneous oxidation reactions is carried out, with the model identifying the suitable kinetic reactions for gasification. Predicted CFD modelling results are compared with those from the kinetic modelling and experimental results, where a good agreement is obtained. The effect of gasifier temperature, equivalence ratio (ER) and biomass feed rate on the syngas production is studied. Further, the effect of volatile composition and rate of Boudouard reaction at different ERs along the gasifier height is investigated.},

	abstract = {Mainstream biomass precombustion processes include anaerobic digestion (AD), gasification (GS), fast pyrolysis (FP), and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Precombustion processes determine the forms of biomass-derived fuels, the energy production per mass of biomass and the creation of pollutants; consequently, it is important to determine the impacts of precombustion processes on these metrics. Current environmental evaluation methods have limitations when comparing various technologies. Accordingly, we proposed an index for the environmental impact of biomass preprocessing (EIBP), which includes carbon footprint reduction, pollutant impacts from byproducts and pollutant impacts from residuals. A higher EIBP value implies a worse environmental impact. We evaluated the EIBPs for a variety of processes and feedstocks. Technical levels of these processes were quantified by carbon conversion, which is equal to the sum of the carbon mass in the target products and byproducts divided by the total carbon mass in the feedstock. By adjusting the carbon conversion, we inferred the environmental potentials of these processes. We found that AD had the lowest EIBP and EIBP lower bound, the latter of which refers to the theoretically lowest EIBP under idealized conditions. This result implies that AD is likely to maintain its environmental impact advantage for a decade. Although the newly developed HTL technology had the highest EIBP for almost all feedstocks, it had an extremely high environmental impact improvement potential. The correlation analysis between the energy conversion efficiency and the EIBP showed that they do not necessarily have strong correlations, suggesting that environmental impact should be considered separately when optimizing biomass precombustion processes.},

	abstract = {Maximizing resource recovery from waste streams (e.g., energy) is a critical challenge for municipalities. Utilizing the ultimate analysis and high heat value (HHV), we investigated the energy recovery and emission characteristics for 252 solid wastes of a diverse range of geographical origins classifications (e.g., 30 paper, 12 textile, 12 rubber and leather, 29 MSW mixture, 34 plastic, 61 wood, 20 sewage sludge and 53 other wastes) under the thermal waste-to-energy operation. Given the significance of wastes’ HHV data, we proposed a rapid and cost-effective methodology for filling the gaps in the experimental data by prediction of the missing or uncertain wastes’ HHV. We further employed wastes’ nitrogen and sulphur contents to assess their atmospheric emissions. The results from this analysis show the highest energy content belonged to plastic waste, but higher levels of air pollution (mainly due to nitrogen and sulfur) could be emitted during thermal energy recovery of sewage sludge, rubber, and textile wastes. Also, we demonstrated more significant potential for recovering energy from plastic, wood, and paper wastes, while emitting less nitrogen and sulphur compounds to the atmosphere. Finally, our presented HHV models outperform concerning generalizability, validity, and accuracy when comparing the obtained results to those of previously published models. The results from this present study are particularly advantageous in designing sustainable thermal waste-to-energy systems to facilitate cities' transition into a circular economy.},

In this study, the evolutions of microstructures in biowaste-derived hydrochars were explored and subsequently correlated with the changes on pyrolysis and gasification reactivities. Meanwhile, the catalytic effect of specific alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) on gasification process was also analyzed. Experimental results showed that the pore structures and specific surface area of hydrochar were improved with the increased temperatures, and hydrochar grindability was better than their original sample. However, these changes did not function in a positive way on pyrolysis or gasification as previous studies supposed, which might be inhibited by the competitively negative effects from the developed aromaticity in hydrochar. The comparison of hydrochars with and without acid washing demonstrated the self-catalysis reactions of intrinsic AAEMs in ash, but the extent was varied as the differences on its types and contents. By means of quantitatively reloading specific AAEMs in hydrochar, potassium (K) and sodium (Na), compared to iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca), performed a relatively stronger catalytic effect on gasification process, which significantly enhanced the average gasification reactivity of sample.},

A coupled system model of biomass gasification coupled to a coal-fired boiler is established in Aspen Plus and successfully validated by experimental data. A 20 t/h straw gasifier operates at the rated capacity and the straw gas is introduced to the boiler running at different loads. The co-firing ratio increases with the reduction of boiler load. Results indicate that the main parameters, such as furnace combustion temperature, flue gas temperature, and NO and SO2 emission decrease with the reduction of boiler load. Compared to pure coal combustion, co-firing can reduce the furnace combustion temperature and increase the flue gases temperature. More importantly, the coal consumption, and NO and SO2 emissions are reduced at all loads, especially at lower loads. The excess air ratio should be adjusted to obtain the optimum combustion performance in the furnace, but there is still a slight drop of around 0.2\% in boiler efficiency when co-firing. Meanwhile, the coupled system efficiency at various loads can reach slightly more than 84\% under optimum conditions.},

	abstract = {A technology of sewage sludge (SS) pyrolysis coupled with self-supplied steam reforming of the volatile is developed to utilize the latent heat of the steam vapor released in the SS drying \& pyrolysis process. An integrated reactor consisting of a vertical free-falling pyrolysis section and a horizontal screw-moved reforming section is designed for this purpose. The performance of the reactor shows that by changing the moving speed of the char in the reforming section, high quality syngas with an H2/CO ratio of 4.37 and a percentage of H2 + CO up to 66.58 vol\% can be obtained at approximately 570–600 °C for the dry SS. There is an optimum moving speed of the screw for producing the highest volume of the syngas. A higher moving speed of the screw also results in a higher concentration of the aromatic compounds in the final pyrolysis oil. When the initial moisture content of SS increases from 0 to 65.50\%, the H2/CO ratio and H2/CO2 ratio in the syngas increase from 4.37 to 30.87 and from 2.1 to 2.6 correspondingly, and the final oil yield decreases from 24.03 wt\% to 14.16 wt\%. Moreover, the total energy recovery efficiency decreases from 88.85\% to 61.92\%, while the energy portion of syngas shows a peak of 44.18\% of the total energy input when the initial moisture content is 41.26\%. The integrated reactor also provides a good opportunity for adding a catalyst such as dolomite to make the process more effective. The technology developed in this paper provides an approach to deal with SS with a relatively high moisture content.},

However, due to carbon deposition, the deactivation of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is still a serious issue. In this work, the effects of lanthanum (La) as promoter on the properties and catalytic performance of Ni/Al2O3 in SCWG of food waste were investigated. La promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with different La loading content (3–15 wt\%) were prepared via impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, SEM, BET techniques. The SCWG experiments were carried out in a Hastelloy batch reactor in the operating temperature range of 420–480 °C, and evaluated based on H2 production. The stability of the catalysts was assessed by the amount of carbon deposition on catalyst surface and their catalytic activity after reuse cycles. The results showed that 9 wt\% La promoter is the optimal loading as Ni/9La–Al2O3 catalyst performed best performance with the highest H2 yield of 8.03 mol/kg, and H2 mole fraction of 42.46\% at 480 °C. La promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts have better anti-carbon deposition properties than bare Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, resulting in better gasification efficiency after reuse cycles. Ni/9La–Al2O3 catalyst showed high catalytic activity in SCWG of food waste and had good stability as it was still active for enhancing H2 production when used in SCWG for the third time, which indicated that La promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts are potential additive to improve the SCWG of food waste.},

	abstract = {In order to explore the different characteristics of bio-fuels generated by microwave pyrolysis of sludge in the temperature and power control modes, the differences in the distribution, composition, lower heating value and energy utilization efficiency have been analyzed. The heat conversion mechanism was preliminarily explored via changes in the dielectric constants of the sludge. The results showed that: First, there were differences between the two modes during the pyrolysis process. This was the main reason that the lower heating value of the products in the temperature control mode was higher than it in the power control mode. For instance, the lower heating values of bio-gas and bio-oil generated at 800 °C were 16.04 MJ/kg and 35.96 MJ/kg, respectively. Second, the energy utilization efficiency of the temperature control mode was higher than that of the power control mode. This was because the required microwave energy input in the temperature control mode (40.32–65.52 MJ) was lower than that in the power control mode (72.80–88.00 MJ). This can be proven by the integral calculation results of output power and reaction time. Third, during the process of microwave pyrolysis, the ability of sludge to absorb microwave energy and convert it into heat (tanθ) first decreased and then increased due to the water evaporation and subsequent formation of pyrolysis residues. Therefore, choosing a suitable pyrolysis mode (temperature control mode) and condition (800 °C) is crucial to improving the efficiencies of resource recovery and energy utilization.},

In the process of TSR, 9Ni/FZ5 was kept above 70\% for 7 h.

A thermodynamic equilibrium approach using Gibbs free energy minimization method has been assumed for the evaluation of suitable conditions for the oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of biomass fast pyrolysis volatiles. The simulation has been carried out contemplating a wide range of reforming operating conditions, i.e., temperature (500–800 °C), steam/biomass (S/B) ratio (0–4) and equivalence ratio (ER) (0–0.2). It is to note that the simulation results under steam reforming (SR) conditions are consistent with those obtained by experiments. Temperatures between 600 and 700 °C, S/B ratios in the 2–3 range and ER values of around 0.12 are the optimum conditions for the OSR under autothermal reforming (ATR) conditions, as they allow attaining high hydrogen yields (10 wt\% by mass unit of the biomass in the feed), which are only 12–15\% lower than those obtained under SR conditions.},

The main aim of the work was to produce H2-rich syngas and simultaneously reduce tar. The main reaction variable was the steam-to-fuel ratio. The possibility of gasification without using an electrostatic precipitator was also examined in the study. In addition, the effect of the type of distributor (hook-type and mesh-type distributor) located between the fluidized bed gasifier and tar-cracking reactor on coke formation was investigated. Finally, the possibility of in situ regeneration of active carbon with steam was explored. As a result, the syngas from the two-stage gasifier contained a maximum 66 vol\% hydrogen and a minimum 0 mg/Nm3 tar. The syngas produced without using an electrostatic precipitator had similar quality to that obtained with an electrostatic precipitator, providing a positive indication for the implementation of the two-stage gasifier in commercial applications. Additionally, the mesh-type distributor was found to be excellent against coke formation. The in situ regeneration of active carbon with steam significantly recovered the textural properties of the original active carbon, yielding a surface area recovery rate of approximately 63\%. A long-term gasification for 4 h with repetitive in situ regeneration of active carbon with steam produced a syngas having 55 vol\% H2 on average and toluene as a tar component.},

In this study, we examined the hydrothermal conversion of sludge over a large range of conditions (300–600 °C, 1–60 min) that included both nominally isothermal processing and non-isothermal processing (rapid heating, short times). An empirical severity index was employed to combine the effects of reaction temperature and holding time into a single parameter. The highest biocrude yields (20.1–30.9 wt\%) were achieved at 10−1 {\textless} severity index {\textless} 102 and about 32\% and 63\% of the nitrogen in sludge transferred into the biocrude and aqueous phase products, respectively. A Van Krevelen diagram illustrated that dehydration and decarboxylation pathways were important for biocrude and light biocrude formation whereas dehydration paths were more important for heavy biocrude. We developed a quantitative kinetics model that faithfully correlated the effects of time and temperature on the yields of biocrude, aqueous phase products, solid, gas, and volatiles. It also accurately predicted the yields of the product fractions from hydrothermal liquefaction at 350 °C.},

We propose the reduction of SSL-derived biochar toxicity by it co-pyrolysis with biomass and in CO2 atmosphere. Ecotoxicity of biochars produced at 500, 600, and 700 °C from SSL and SSL with the addition of willow (at a ratio of SSL:willow - 8:2 and 6:4, w/w) in an atmosphere of N2 or CO2 were investigated. The toxicity of aqueous extracts derived from the biochars (Lepidium sativum - Elongation test, Vibrio fischeri - Microtox) or solid-phase toxicity (Lepidium sativum - Phytotoxkit F, Folsomia candida - Collembolan test) was also studied. SSL-derived biochar produced at N2 atmosphere usually was toxic for all tested organisms. Co-pyrolysis of mixed feedstock reduced the toxicity of the produced biochar. In the case of biochars produced from SSL and willow under N2 atmosphere decrease in inhibition of F. candida reproduction (from 27 to 58\%) or its stimulation (from 7 to 30\%) in comparison to SSL alone derived biochar, was observed. Co-pyrolysis of SSL with willow significantly reduced the toxicity of extracts the SSL-derived biochar towards L. sativum. The aqueous extracts obtained from the biochars produced at temperatures of 500 and 600 °C with willow addition were also less toxic to V. fischeri than the biochars produced from SSL alone. The change of carrier gas from N2 to CO2, regardless of the feedstock used, in most cases reduced toxicity or positively affected the test organisms. This was probably caused by changes in the physicochemical properties and content of contaminants in the biochars produced in an atmosphere of CO2, compared to N2. An exception was root growth inhibition in the solid phase tests where no significant differences were found between biochars produced in N2 and CO2.},

In this work, the effect of temperature (650 °C, 750 °C, 850 °C and 950 °C) on the co-gasification of digestate and lignite was thoroughly investigated in a downdraft fixed bed gasifier. The results showed that the increase of gasification temperature increased the gas yield and the lower heating value (LHV) of product gas. Physicochemical properties of biochar were characterized by physical adsorption analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyzer (TG). It was shown that the average pore diameter increased in the range of 650 °C to 950 °C, while specific surface area and pore volume first increased from 650 °C to 850 °C and then decreased at 950 °C. The Raman analysis of biochar indicated that small aromatic rings condensed to large aromatic ring and increased the content of Caromatic-Calkyl and the crosslinking density at higher temperature. The variation of biochar properties at the higher temperature caused a decrease in the gasification reactivity. With the increase of temperature, the content of carbolic oil in the tar increased, but the contents of light oil, naphthalene oil and washing oil decreased. This study comprehensively analyzed the products properties and demonstrated the feasibility of co-gasification of digestate and lignite.},

High reaction temperature, long residence time, and low feedstock concentration favoured higher molecular weight (HMW) PAH formation.

The main PAHs formed in the liquid phase and the solid residue were 3-ring and 4-ring PAHs, which were generated from the cycloaddition reaction of lower molecular weight (LMW) PAHs. In addition, 2-ring PAHs were produced from the Diels-Alder reaction of phenols and unsaturated hydrocarbons. The possible control methods for PAH formation during the SCWG of cyanobacterial biomass were proposed. H2O2 addition effectively inhibited the reaction pathways underlying PAH formation, and the addition at more than 1.0\% concentration suppressed H2 production.

	abstract = {A new “centrifuge-first” approach was developed to recover a large amount of bio-oil produced during hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of dewatered sewage sludge (DWSS). The entire mixture produced from HTL was first centrifuged to separate the water + water-soluble organics (WSOs) phase from the bio-oil (BO) + solid residue phase, and subsequently, bio-oil was separated from solid residue by simple filtering. The HTL of DWSS at an optimum condition of 325 °C and 12–14 MPa for 30 min resulted in a DWSS conversion of 88\%. Under this optimum condition, using the centrifuge-first approach, the yield of bio-oil recovered was 64 wt\%, a value that was much higher than that of LLE with dichloromethane (47 wt\%) or ethyl acetate (41 wt\%). The centrifuge-first approach can be applied to recover bio-oil produced at a variety of HTL parameters, including temperature (300–400 °C), time (30–120 min), and pressure (25–36 MPa). The O/C ratios, calorific values of the bio-oils, and average molecular weights were in the range of 0.03–0.05, 33–36 MJ kg−1, and 130–190 g mol−1, respectively, demonstrating that they were not very sensitive to the process parameters. In addition to the high energy content, the low water content ({\textless}1 wt\%), low inorganic content ({\textless}1 wt\%), and low acidity (total acid number {\textless}26 mg KOH per g oil) in the bio-oil recovered from the centrifuge-first approach make its use in combustion fuel applications suitable.

	abstract = {Sludge pyrolysis is a complex process including complicated reaction chemistry, phase transition, and transportation phenomena. To better evaluate the use of syngas, the monitoring and prediction of a higher heating value (HHV) is necessary. This study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the HHV of syngas, with the process variables (i.e., sludge type, catalyst type, catalyst amount, pyrolysis temperature, and moisture content) as the inputs. In the first step, through optimizing various sets of parameters, a three-layer network including 8 input neurons, 15 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron was established. Then, in the second step, an ANN model has been successfully used to predict the HHV of syngas, with a fitting correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a root mean square error (MSE) value of 14.62. The relative influence of input variables showed that the pyrolysis temperature and moisture content were the determining factors that affected the HHV of syngas. The results of optimization experiments showed that when temperature was 895 °C and the moisture content was 45.63 wt\%, the highest HHV can be obtained as 438.22 kcal/m3-N. Moreover, the ANN model showed a higher prediction accuracy than other models like multiple linear regression and principal component regression. The model developed in this work may be used to predict the HHV of syngas using conventional operational parameters measured from in situ experiments, thus further providing predictive information for the use of syngas as energy and fuel.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The purpose of this article is to improve the understanding on sewage sludge (SS) pyrolysis behavior in a fluidized bed reactor between 700 and 890 °C. The experiments were carried out under a pure nitrogen atmosphere using sand and olivine as bed materials. The results gathered in this paper highlight the impact of temperature and bed materials on various performance criteria. It was observed that the use of olivine as a bed material affects the composition of the syngas, especially the fraction of the light hydrocarbons CH4 and C2HX. It was also noticed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature yielded more syngas and reduced the condensable species and char quantities. Furthermore, an increase in temperature led to an increase in the fraction of benzene in tars. Comparing different kinds of fuels revealed that SS pyrolysis yields less syngas than pinewood and more syngas than municipal green waste. SS pyrolysis led to significantly higher CH4 and C2HX yields than woody waste, as well as a higher tar quantity. It was also noticed that BTEX compounds account for 70\% of the tars produced during the pyrolysis of each of the fuels that were studied at 850 °C. Findings show that the thermal decomposition of SS generates a syngas rich in H2 (25–37 mol\%), CO (23–40\%), CO2 (6–19\%), CH4 (9–21\%) and C2HX (4–17\%). The syngas lower heating value is varying between 14,000 and 22,000 kJ/Nm3.

Experiments were conducted in a laboratory fluidized bed and in a packed bed reactor under conditions relevant for pyrolysis, gasification and combustion. The concentration of twenty elements in the solid residue was measured as a function of temperature, reaction time, oxidizing atmosphere (O2 and H2O), presence of Cl in the gas and type of reactor gas-solid contact (fluidized vs packed bed). The temperature and the oxidizing conditions in the gas were shown to play a dominant role, whereas the effect of reaction time was negligible. The concentrations of most of main elements increased with temperature, whereas those of most of minor elements followed the opposite trend. The presence of chlorine in the gas resulted in higher concentration of Fe, Mg, Cu, Ni, Zn Co, Sb and V in the residue, while it promoted almost complete volatilization of Pb and Sn. The concentration of minor elements in the residue was lower in packed bed than in fluidized bed, as a result of the higher dilution caused by the lower degradation of the fuel sample in packed bed conditions. The enrichment of the elements in the solid residue decreased with the temperature, being more significant in pyrolysis than in combustion and gasification.},

This study further refined the effects of conditioners on homogeneous and heterogeneous processes during sludge steam gasification using a self-designed decoupling reactor. The results show that compared with raw sludge, the NH3 and HCN yields of conditioned sludge decreased by 13.71–17.67 mL/g and 17.77–23.45 mL/g at 873–1073 K respectively. 50.59–98.76\% of decrement attributed to the synergistic effect of conditioners on volatiles homogeneous reforming, owing to the less NH3, HCN and tar-N yields in devolatilization product as well as the indirect enhancement of HCN hydrolysis. Fenton's reagent added alone exhibited a significant effect on volatiles heterogeneous reforming. During the interaction between volatiles and char, iron salts could catalyze the nitrile-N and pyrrole-N in char conversion to stable indoles in tar and inhibited the hydrolysis of amine-N to release NH3. Calcium salts also showed a certain capability on the co-decomposition of quaternary-N in char and indoles/quinolones in tar to harmless N2. Thus, the combination of Fenton's reagent and CaO can complementarily reduce the emission of NOx precursors at each stage of gasification.},

	abstract = {A model was developed to simulate the sewage sludge gasification in an atmospheric fluidised bed gasifier using Aspen Plus. The model here presented was based on the Gibbs free energy minimisation and the restricted equilibrium method was used to calibrate it against previously published experimental data obtained in a lab-scale gasification plant. A sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out by modifying parameters such as the temperature, equivalence ratio (ER) and the steam-to-biomass ratio. The modeled results were in good agreement with the experimental data (especially when air was used as gasifying agent) and reproduced satisfactorily the experimental trends found for the gas composition, the carbon conversion (Xc) and the cold gas efficiency (CGE) under different gasification conditions. Operating at higher temperatures increased the production of H2 and CO, as well as the Xc and the CGE. The increase in ER produced higher Xc, yet the CGE experienced slight changes due to a decrease in the lower heating value of the resulting syngas, as well as the oxidation of combustible gases. The use of air+steam as gasifying agent increased the H2 content of the produced gases but decreased the accuracy of the model. Implications: Gasification is an available alternative to produce energy as well as several raw materials from sewage sludge. The syngas obtained from this technology totally depends on the type of gasifier and the operation conditions, which can be optimized with the help of models. In this work, a relatively simple model was built using ASPEN PLUS. Despite its simplicity, the outputs of the model are in good agreement with experimental results what makes its use interesting for assessing scaling-up possibilities from lab-scale to pilot-scale gasification processes.},

Both physical and chemical structural characteristics of the bio-chars were analyzed to reveal the evolution of bio-char structure during the co-pyrolysis. Results showed that the inherent moisture of MSS had gasification effect on the structure of bio-char generated from both MSS itself and WW. With the increase of WW content, the BET surface area of bio-chars increased from 68.49 cm2 g−1 to 119.52 cm2 g−1 due to the high surface area of WW-char (150.59 cm2 g−1). But the average pore sizes of all mixed samples were smaller than 10 nm, which indicated that the MSS-char particles would block the WW-char particles. According to the Raman spectra and XRD results, the inherent moisture was beneficial for the formation of functional groups (mainly carbonyl group) on the bio-char surface. However, the excess moisture led to the additional carbonaceous component consumption and decreased the Raman intensity.},

	abstract = {An integrated system of supercritical water gasification (SCWG) and combined cycle has been developed for H2 production and power generation. Sewage sludge and lignite coal were selected as raw material in this simulation. The effects of feed concentration (10–30 wt\%) and lignite coal addition (0–50 wt\%) on syngas yield and H2 yield were also investigated in the temperature range of 500 °C–700 °C. Several heat exchangers were considered in the proposed integrated system to minimize energy loss. High pressure syngas was expanded by using turbo-expander to produce electricity, resulting in the improvement of the total efficiency. The results showed that the minimum feed concentrations of 14.25 wt\%, 18.75 wt\%, and 25.50 wt\% were required to achieve self-sufficient energy at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C, respectively. However, the lower feed concentration and higher temperature were preferable for syngas production. The highest syngas and H2 yield were obtained at 700 °C and 10 wt\% feed concentration. The SCWG could produce 178.08 kg syngas from 100 kg feed and 9.06 kg H2 were obtained after H2 separation. The total power generation from turbo-expander and combined cycle module was 48.37 kW. By combining SCWG and combined cycle, the total efficiency could reach 63.48\%. It worth mentioning that the addition of lignite coal could help reduce the minimum feed concentration to achieve autothermal condition, but did not have significant improvement on H2 production.},

Both valuable products and polluting materials were considered. Regarding the latter one, we for the first time proposed the principles of competitive effect and linkage effect in the silicate category, and accordingly, we put forward a general clue for trace element fixations. For syngas, the total yield composed of CO, H2 and CH4 increased while the char yield decreased in the presence of ash and CaO; for polluting gases, the presence of CaO had a pronounced mitigation effect. Then the distributions of trace elements were identified by analyzing their network roles. For the network modifiers such as Ba and Zn, CaO weakened their fixation due to the competitive effect while Al2O3 and ash had a positive effect due to the linkage effect. For the network formers such as As and the elements with large atomic radius such as Co, CaO improved their fixation due to the linkage effect whilst Al2O3 and ash had an negative effect. Accordingly, we acquire significant ideas for clean and effective utilization of sludge, as well as coal and other solid wastes.},

	abstract = {CO2 co-gasification of horticultural waste (HW) and sewage sludge (SS) with addition of ash from waste as catalyst in a fixed-bed lab-scale gasifier was comprehensively investigated using Box-Behnken experiment design. Influence of three operating parameters, i.e. loaded ash content, operating temperature, and gasifying agent flow rate was studied. Among the three parameters, temperature is the main driving force for enhancement of cold gas efficiency (CGE) and higher heating value (HHV) of the produced syngas. An increase in the gasifying agent flow rate is found to positively impact CGE, but to negatively affect the HHV of the produced syngas and the CO2 reduction ratio. The increase in ash content is observed to have a negative effect at the beginning, followed by a positive effect near the end on both CGE and HHV of the produced syngas at low temperature. Mathematical models of good accuracy, with R2 0.994 and 0.989 for CGE and HHV of the produced syngas respectively, were developed for optimization of the different indices of the co-gasification process by response surface methodology (RSM). Finally, a KIVA-CHEMKIN based CFD model was implemented to study the combustion performance of the produced syngas in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The engine efficiency is observed to be proportional to HHV of the produced syngas, while inversely proportional to its CO2 content, which may cause engine failure when exceeds 74\%v/v, in the present study.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge (SS) is a by-product of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operation. Due to fast rates of urbanization and industrialization, and rapid population growth, the world community faces a serious challenge associated with its disposal. There is an urgent need to explore low cost, energy efficient, and sustainable solutions for the treatment, management, and future utilization of SS. Thermal conversion of SS is considered the most promising alternative for sustainable SS management. Among three main thermochemical processes, it seems that gasification (GAS) of SS has the most advantages. The aim of this paper is a presentation of the gasification process as a sustainable method of SS management that takes into account the idea of a circular economy (CE). Gaseous fuel production, phosphorus recovery potential, and solid adsorbent production during the gasification process are analyzed and discussed. Result of this study shows that the lower heating value (LHV) of the gas from SS GAS process is up to 5 MJ/m3n and it can be effectively utilize in an internal combustion engines. The analysis proved that solid fraction after the SS GAS process can be treated as a valuable phosphorus source and perspective adsorbent materials. The amount of P2O5 in this material was equal to 22.06\%. It is similar to natural phosphate rocks (28.05\%). The maximum of the adsorption capacity of the phenol was comparable with commercial activated carbon (CAC): 42.22 mg/g for solid fraction after SS GAS and 49.72 mg/g for CAC.

	abstract = {A significant challenge in the utilization of alternative gaseous fuels is to use their energy potential at the desired location, considering economic feasibility and sustainability. A potential solution is a compression, transportation in pressure tanks, and generation of electricity and heat directly at the recipient. In this research, the potential for generating syngas from abundant waste substrates was analyzed. The sewage sludge (SS) was used as an example of a bulky and abundant resource that could be valorized via gasification, compression, and transport to end-users in containers. A model was developed, and theoretical analyses were completed to examine the influence of the calorific value of the syngas produced from the SS gasification (under different temperatures and gasifying agents) on the efficiency of energy transportation of compressed syngas. First, the gasification simulation was carried out, assuming equilibrium in a downdraft gasifier (reactor) from 973-1473 K and five gasifying agents (O2, H2, CO2, water vapor, and air). Molar ratios of the gasifying agents to the (SS) C ranged from 0.1-1.0. The model predicted syngas composition, lower calorific values (LHV) for a given molar ratio of the gasification agent, and compressibility factor. It was shown that the highest LHV was obtained at 0.1 molar ratio for all gasifier agents. The highest LHV ({\textasciitilde}20 MJ·(Nm3)-1) was obtained by gasification with H2 and the lowest ({\textasciitilde}13 MJ·(Nm3)-1) in the case of air. Next, the available syngas volume in a compressed gas transportation unit and the stored energy was estimated. The largest syngas volume can be transported when O2 is used as a gasifying agent, but the highest amount of transported energy was estimated for gasification with H2. Finally, the techno-economic analyses showed that syngas from SS could be competitive when the energy of compressed syngas is compared with the demand of an average residential dwelling. The developed syngas energy transport system (SETS) concept proposes a new method to distribute compressed syngas in pressure tanks to end-users using all modes of transport carrying intermodal ISO containers. Future work should include the determination of energy demand for syngas compression, including pressure losses, heat losses, and analysis of the influence of syngas on storage and compression devices.},

The temperature domains of transformation were determined and indications of the main compounds produced during each stage were obtained. Results showed that the volatile compounds that evolved after sludge pyrolysis were mainly distributed into six groups: alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols and carboxylic acids. Comparison in thermal behavior and composition of the evolved volatile compounds were observed. In the low temperature stage ({\textless}350 ◦C), compounds containing O–C=O accounted for the highest proportion in the evolved gas (55\%). Over 350 ◦C, the production of C=C, –OH, and –C6H5 compounds gradually increased; but little was found of compounds containing O–C=O. Above 550 ◦C, as thermal chemical reaction involving oxygen-containing groups enhanced, compounds containing O–C=O and –OH tended to disappear, and an increasing amount of macromolecular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was formed. Finally, the thermal transformation pathways of the oxygen and carbon-containing compounds were proposed.},

The proposed configuration offers the potential for the production of syngas at different H2:CO ratios for various applications such as the Fischer–Tropsch process or fuel cells, and it is a path for addressing the common challenges associated with conventional gasification plants such as nitrogen dilution and ash separation. The proposed concept consists of two reactors, R1 and R2, where the carbon containing fuel is gasified (in reactor R1) and in reactor R2, the quality of the syngas (H2:CO ratio) is substantially improved. Reactor R1 is a supercritical water gasifier and reactor R2 is a water–gas shift reactor. The proposed concept was modelled using the Gibbs minimization method with HSC chemistry software. Our results show that the supercritical water to fuel ratio (SCW/C) is a key parameter for determining the quality of syngas (molar ratio of H2:CO) and the carbon conversion reaches 100\%, when the SWC/C ratio ranges between two and 2.5 at 500–1000 ◦C.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the economic feasibility of generating a novel, innovative biofuel- bioenergy-obtained from deposit bio-components by means of a pilot installation of sewage sludge bio-conversion. Fuel produced from sewage sludge biomass bears the potential of being considered a renewable energy source. In the present study, 23 bioconversion cycles were conducted taking into consideration the different contents, types of high carbohydrate additives, moisture content of the mixture as well as the shape of the bed elements. The biofuel was produced using post fermentation sewage sludge for industrial energy and heat generation. Based on the presented research it was concluded that the composite biofuel can be co-combusted with hard coal with the optimal percentage share within the range of 20-30\% w/w. Sewage sludge stabilized by means of anaerobic digestion carried out in closed fermentation chambers is the final product. The average values of the CO2, CO, NO, NOx and SO2 concentrations in flue gas from co-combustion of a bioconversion product (20\% w/w) and coal were 5.43\%, 1903 ppm, 300 ppm, 303 ppm and 179 ppm, respectively. In total, within a period of 4.5 years of the plant operation, 1853 Mg of fuel was produced and successfully co-combusted with coal in a power plant. The research demonstrated that in the waste water treatment sector there exists energy potential in terms of calorific value which translates into tangible benefits both in the context of energy generation as well as environmental protection. Over 700,000 Mg of bio-sewage sludge is generated annually in Poland. According to findings of the study presented in the paper, the proposed solution could give 970,000 Mg of dry mass of biomass qualified as energy biomass replacing fossil fuels.},

	abstract = {Thermogravimetry (TG) is the fast and reliable method for characterization of thermal decomposition of any material and in particular to determine the kinetics of pyrolytic decomposition of sewage sludge. Two types of sewage sludge with and without addition of lime were investigated from kinetic point of view. For TG analysis samples of selected sewage sludge were heated under the inert atmosphere of argon with constant heating rate from 303 to 1273 K; the three heating rate β = 5, 10 and 20 K/min were chosen. The iso-conversion methods of Friedman and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall were employed for analysis of TG results. As the sewage sludge decomposition is very complex process it cannot be described by a simple stoichiometric equation, therefore the so called lumping of reactions in the selected temperature ranges were used with detailed principles arising from visual analysis of DTG curve. The deconvolution of DTG curves performed according to Fraser-Suzuki asymmetric profile allowed the identification of number of lumps and their contribution to the overall mass loss. So the decomposition of sewage sludge with lime addition could be described with five groups of reactions while the one without lime by means of six lumps. The thermal decomposition of sewage sludge was assumed to proceed according to the scheme of parallel concurrent independent reactions of n-th order. The values of the apparent activation energies at different constant values of conversion degrees were determined by the iso-conversion analysis. To estimate the kinetic parameters the non-linear regression with Levenberg-Marquart optimization procedure was used. The kinetic parameters such as activation energy, pre-exponential factor, reaction order and fraction of total mass loss associated with a given reaction were determined. The impact of sewage sludge liming revealed in essential differences of pyrolysis products and pyrolysis kinetics of limed sludge and without lime one was highlighted.},

	abstract = {The traditional methods of disposing of petroleum sludge are short of providing the much-needed benign treatment. A more robust treatment technique is desirable. In this investigation, a laboratory-scale thermal plasma reactor was developed and was used to treat 20 g per batch of petroleum oily sludge. The output current and the plasma temperature measured using an infrared thermometer range were 5 - 200 A and 356 - 1694 °C respectively. After the plasma treatment, the morphology of the sludge transformed from jelly-like to crystalline solid structure. A mass and volume reductions of 36.87 - 91.40\% and 59.59 - 94.52\%, respectively, were achieved in a treatment period of 2 - 5 min. A Total Organic Compound (TOC) reduction of 21.47 - 93.76\% were equally achieved in same treatment period. Heavy metals concentration in the sludge were increased after the plasma treatment, whereas, Ni and Pb manifested only in the solid residue. The result of the leaching test of heavy metals from the solid residue is within the US EPA recommended level for secure landfill. The major components of the flue gas were H2, CO, CO2 and H2O with small quantities of CH4, C2H2 and C2H4. The flue gas has an LHV range of 7.40 - 7.86 MJ/Nm3 with a corresponding cold gas efficiency of 25.22 - 51.90\%. Based on the operating cost estimation, a profit margin of \$ 0.76 /kg of sludge was established. The thermal plasma technique is, therefore, an alternative treatment method for treating petroleum sludge.},

The pH, electrical conductivity (EC), specific surface area (SBET), elemental composition (CHNO), and mineral composition (XRD), as well as functional groups (FT-IR/PAS) were identified and determined. Replace the N2 by CO2 as carrier gas influenced the properties of the all produced biochars. CO2 had an effect on reducing the process efficiency as well as pH and EC in the SSL-derived biochars. Changes in the elemental composition (H and O content) were also noted after change of carrier gases. In the biochars obtained in a CO2, a negative correlation was found between EC and pyrolysis temperature. In the biochars produced from SSL and willow, apart from similar changes to those observed for the biochars made from SSL in the presence of CO2, changes in the surface properties were additionally noted. The biochar obtained in a CO2 atmosphere had higher SBET values (from 19 to 47\%) than the respective biochars produced in an N2 atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Gasification technology can effectively convert the organic substances to combustible gas, but the high content of inorganic matter in sludge will cause a large amount of gasification ash needed to be utilized remaining. On the basis of our previous study, Fenton's reagent (Fe 2+ /H 2 O 2 ) and CaO conditioning brought more Fe- and Ca-containing compounds, providing the potential for gasification ash as adsorbent. This study explored the mechanism of sludge gasification ash sorbent for sulfur and nitrogen containing pollutants removal. Conditioned sludge was gasified in a lab-scale fixed bed at 873 and 1173 K, then SO 2 , H 2 S and NH 3 adsorption experiments were conducted in a self-designed reactor to evaluate in situ adsorption capacity of gasification ash. According to the results, gasification ash was more suitable for the adsorption and degradation of H 2 S and NH 3 at high temperature with outlet concentration reaching the minimum of 14 and 30 ppm respectively. Iron substances can promote the surface structure of ash, while the surface area pretreated with CaO was increased twice as large as that of raw sludge ash, which can partly explain the SO 2 adsorption performance. The raw sludge gasification ash mainly promoted the decomposition of H 2 S to sulfur, while the iron and calcium salts in gasification ash converted H 2 S to sulfides and sulfates cooperatively. As for NH 3 , the adsorbents also showed great removal effect at 873 K, mainly depending on the carbon structure and surface Lewis acid sites measured by in situ FTIR. With temperature increasing, the catalytic effect of calcium and iron compounds, which can react with NH 3 to form intermediates, played a dominant role in the decomposition of NH 3 .},

	abstract = {As known, dried sewage sludge, is a by-product produced from waste water treatment, contains significant amounts of organic content, and makes up to 60\% with overall calorific value from 9 to 12 MJ/kg. Hence, it can be considered as material for thermal processing focusing on heat and power production. Among thermal conversion technologies, gasification is seen as the effective one because it can be easily combined with heat and power cogeneration units. On the other hand, due to high mineral content (40–50\%) in the sludge, it is difficult to be gasified and obtain syngas with calorific value satisfactory enough for fueling the internal combustion engine. The dried sludge can be subjected to be gasified at temperature above 850 ◦C. However, large amounts of mineral content do not provide favorable conditions to obtain this required temperature. Thus, it is proposed to enrich the sewage sludge with biomass characterized with significantly higher calorific value. In the article, co-gasification of sewage sludge and Virginia Mallow—energetic crops was investigated. Results from experimental and numerical investigation have been presented. The dried sewage sludge enriched with Virginia Mallow at a mass ratio of 0/100\%, 50/50\% and 100/0\% in tests and in the range from 0 to 100\% for theoretical analysis was applied in order to achieve effective gasification process. As observed, lignocellulosic biomass like Virginia Mallow contains low amounts of mineral content below 2\%, which makes it appropriate for thermal processing. It contributes to more stable and efficient gasification process. Additionally, Virginia Mallow caused that the process temperature possible to achieve, was 950 ◦C. Thus, sewage sludge was mixed with this high-energy component in order to improve the gasification parameters and obtain syngas with higher calorific value. A zero-dimensional, two-zone model was developed with aid of the POLIMI kinetics mechanism developed by CRECK Modeling Group to simulate gasification of low calorific substances enriched with high calorific biomass. Obtained results showed that sewage sludge can be completely gasified at presence of Virginia Mallow. Syngas calorific value of approximately 5 MJ/Nm3 was produced from this gasification process. The maximal percentage of Virginia Mallow in the mixture with the sewage sludge was set at 50\% due to economic aspects of the technology. It was found, that satisfactory conditions for effective gasification were achieved at this 50/50\% percentage of sewage sludge and Virginia Mallow. Potential intensity of gasification was predicted from this 0-D 2-zones model, which calculates area of reduction zone to area of combustion zone. This reduction-to-combustion area ratio for the sewage sludge-Virginia Mallow mixture was estimated at value of 2. Finally, the model was successfully verified with results from tests, hence it was proposed as a tool for preliminary investigation on poor fuels gasification.},

This includes sustainability in terms of electricity consumption. Although a great deal of work has been performed so far regarding the gasification of sewage sludge and some investigations have been performed in the area of its torrefaction, there is still a gap in terms of the influence of the torrefaction of the sewage sludge on its subsequent gasification. This study presents the results from the torrefaction tests, performed on a pilot scale reactor, as well as two consecutive steam gasification tests, performed in an allothermal fixed bed gasifier, in order to determine if torrefaction can be deemed as a primary method of the reduction of tar content for the producer gas, from the aforementioned gasification process. A comparative analysis is performed based on the results obtained during both tests, with special emphasis on the concentrations of condensable compounds (tars). The obtained results show that the torrefaction of sewage sludge, performed prior to gasification, can indeed have a positive influence on the gas quality. This is beneficial especially in terms of the content of heavy tars with melting points above 40 C.},

Naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene (light polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon tars) were also generated, but in relatively small amounts. Ammonia and hydrogen cyanide (precursor for NOx) were generated from thermal decomposition of tar containing protein and nitrogen in sewage sludge.

	abstract = {Abstract: Sewage sludge is a by-product of wastewater treatment, containing high water and organic content. Supercritical water gasification provides sustainable treatment for biomass sources such as sewage sludge. In this study, the effects of operating conditions (temperature, solid matter content and catalyst) and raw material properties on the resulting liquid products were determined in order to exhibit the success of this innovative technology for treatment and disposal of municipal sewage sludge using a continuous flow pilot-scale tubular reactor for the first time in Turkey. As a result of the study, it was determined that the higher the temperature, the higher the quality of the liquid product. TOC removal efficiencies increased from 84.4\% to 99\% with increasing the temperature from 450 to 650 °C, for 1\% solid matter content. The pollutant concentrations in the liquid products increased by increasing the solid matter content of the raw sludge from 1 to 2\%. This situation has been eliminated by the catalyst (KOH) addition, resulting in a very transparent liquid product. Additionally, TOC removal of 99.8\% was obtained after addition of 2\% catalyst. Thus, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) has been considered as a notable technology for the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge without the need of additional pre- or post-treatment.

Two temperature regions: I (200–400 °C) and II (400–600 °C) are identified and best fitted with different models. Among all models, diffusion models show high activation energy with higher R 2 (0.99) of rice husk (66.27–82.77 kJ/mol), sewage sludge (52.01–68.01 kJ/mol) and subsequent blends (45.10–65.81 kJ/mol) for region I and for rice husk (7.31–25.84 kJ/mol), sewage sludge (1.85–16.23 kJ/mol) and blends (4.95–16.32 kJ/mol) for region II, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters are calculated using kinetics data to assess the co-pyrolysis process enthalpy, Gibbs-free energy, and change in entropy. Artificial neural network (ANN) models are developed and employed on co-pyrolysis thermal decomposition data to study the reaction mechanism by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). The co-pyrolysis results from a thermal behavior and kinetics perspective are promising and the process is viable to recover organic materials more efficiently.},

	abstract = {The co-gasification of coal and dried sewage sludge (DSS) was conducted using a two-stage gasifier consisting of a fluidized bed gasifier and a tar-cracking reactor. In this study, the effect of the blending ratio of coal and DSS was investigated. Producer gases that were obtained from the tar-cracking reactor filled with active carbon contained high levels of hydrogen (maximum H2: 27.7 vol\%) and low tar contents (minimum tar: 0 mg/Nm3). Upon gasification of the coal/DSS blends, the hydrogen content decreased and tar content increased with increasing DSS. Blends with coal/DSS ratios of 70/30 and 50/50 showed a synergetic effect on tar reduction, which could be attributed to the high ash content of the DSS. The gasification of the 70\% DSS blend increased the condensed tar yield by only 0.1 wt\%, compared to coal gasification. Lastly, a hot filter filled with Fe-impregnated active carbon was applied to completely remove tar from producer gas, which led to the production of a tar-free and hydrogen-rich gas (30 vol\%). Furthermore, the Fe-impregnated active carbon reduced the H2S content to 229 ppmv. In summary, it was possible to produce a clean gas from coal and DSS blends in the UOS gasification process.},

Improvements of the two-stage gasification in gas upgrading, tar removal and ash separation were confirmed by characteristic analysis of gas, tar, ash and slag. Influence of equivalence ratio (ER), oxygen distribution and gasifying agent were assessed for process optimization. Refined gas with a LHV up to 11.1 MJ/Nm3 and a tar content lower than 1 g/Nm3 was produced. Ash was completely vitrified with a high conversion of fixed carbon and volatile, resulting in a cold gas energy fraction of approximately 80\%. Increasing ER promoted gas production but limited energy conversion efficiency and gas LHV. Proper oxygen distribution among the two stages was beneficial to decrease energy loss and increase gas quality. Increasing oxygen percentage of gasifying agent enhanced combustible gas content and improved overall gasification efficiency.},

In absolute terms, tincal and zeolite play positive roles in enhancing the syngas yield and H2 concentration obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of the IL-pretreated HMCB, but not in comparison with the pyrolysis of the raw biomass. On the contrary, the results demonstrate the synergetic effects of IL-based pretreatment of HMCB and its catalytic gasification toward higher syngas yield and H2/CO ratio with 32 and 153\% increment, respectively, compared to noncatalytic gasification of the raw HMCB.

The obtained results revealed that the combustion process can be divided into five stages, and the interval temperature and mass loss of each stage were given. To explain the combustion characteristics of the oil sludges and semicokes during ignition and subsequent burning in detail, a series of combustion characteristic parameters and the derived comprehensive indexes were determined based on the DTG and DSC results. Both the Starink method and Friedman method were employed to conduct combustion kinetics analysis, and the distribution and mean value of the activation energy were obtained. The emissions of the main combustion products, incomplete combustion products, gaseous pollutants, and oxidizing agent during the combustion process were detected by mass spectrometry. Finally, the product yield from the previous pyrolysis/gasification experiments and the data extracted from the former sections were used to conduct a PCA. The synthetical evaluation results indicated that the comprehensive thermochemical treatment scheme might be a more effective choice for the treatment and recovery of oil sludge.},

All materials were subjected to HTC processes in an aqueous environment at 200 °C for 4 h with a 1:8 biomass to water ratio, using a Zipperclave Stirred Reactor. The physical, chemical analyses and, additionally, fibre, mercury porosimetry analyses and optical microscope images applied to both raw materials and to hydrochars, proved that HTC enhances the energy related properties of lignocellulosic biomass. Whereas, for sewage sludge, the HTC effect is negligible, because most of the carbon is transferred to the HTC liquid phase, confirmed by high COD and high ash content in the sewage sludge hydrochar. Subsequently, the thermo-chemical conversion kinetics of the raw and HTC materials were examined in the TGA analyser through nonisothermal runs. Finally, kinetics analyses were performed by two methods based on the TGA results. The estimated apparent activation energy values obtained by the Coats \& Redfern method were higher than those given by the Arrhenius method, which also gave almost similar values for all samples, shedding doubt on the accuracy of this method for the current experiments. The Coats \& Redfern analysis gave activation energy values which were lower by one half for sewage sludge hydrochars compared to lignocellulosic hydrochars. This indicates the potential of the HTC process for generating sewage sludge hydrochars suitable for co-combustion or co-gasification with other biomass solid fuels.},

We adapted a novel general distributed activation energy model (G-DAEM) with 5 pseudocomponents for the analysis of kinetic evolution with proposing a more applicable approximation to the general temperature integral. The G-DAEM was trained by data for 20 K/min, and the predictions were performed on data for 15 K/min and 25 K/min. The predictions were well matched to the experimental data.

The thermodynamic analysis was conducted by using Aspen Plus simulator based on Gibbs free energy minimization. The effect of temperature (380–460 °C), sludge concentration (5–30 wt\%), and activated carbon addition (2–8 wt\%) on SCWG was experimentally studied. The solid and liquid residues were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) Analyzer. The results showed that higher temperature and lower sludge concentration favored syngas production, leading to higher hydrogen yield. While pressure had no significant effect on the SCWG performance. The TOC and FTIR analyses revealed that organic matters in sewage sludge were decomposed and hydrolyzed into syngas. The addition of activated carbon increased the syngas yield and enhanced the cold gas efficiency. A syngas yield of 6.44 mol/kg containing 38.43\% H2 was obtained from SCWG at 400 °C with the activated carbon loading of 8 wt\%. Moreover, the analysis of heavy metals indicated that SCWG had a positive effect on the stabilization of heavy metals and reduced the leaching toxicity of heavy metals in sewage sludge.},

	abstract = {In order to improve fuel quality of sewage sludge, fruit and agricultural wastes have been selected for hydrothermal co-carbonization. After hydrothermal co-carbonization, organics retention was facilitated, while O/C and H/C atomic ratios of hydrochars were substantially upgraded. Particularly, hydrochar from hydrothermal co-carbonization of sewage sludge with peanut shells at mass ratio of 1:3 (denoted as “SS:PS = 1:3”) showed the highest fuel ratio of 0.79 and its carbon content was increased to 50.0\% with significantly decreased O/C and H/C atomic ratios. Furthermore, higher heating value of hydrochars from hydrothermal co-carbonization was increased by nearly 2.65-fold and reached 21.72 MJ/kg. Moreover, the most favorable aromatization occurred when sewage sludge and peanut shells blending ratio was 3:1 or 1:1, whereas hydrothermal co-carbonization induced more [sbnd]C[dbnd]O and [sbnd]OH than [sbnd]COOH in hydrochars due to synergistic decarboxylation. A relatively higher value of point of zero charge for hydrochars from hydrothermal co-carbonization implied improved hydrophobicity. Combustion kinetics results indicated that hydrothermal co-carbonization balanced activation energies of hydrochars in devolatilization/combustion stage and char combustion process, rendering a more stable and lasting combustion profile. Hydrochars “SS:PS = 1:3” demonstrated desirable combustion performance. Therefore, hydrothermal co-carbonization can realize sustainable utilization of organic solid wastes towards superior hydrochar solid biofuels.},

In this study, the formation of char/tar by the hydrothermal gasification of dewatered sewage sludge at 300–400 °C for 5–90 min with a heating rate of 8–50 °C/min is investigated. The results showed that the formation of tar/char reached equilibrium after 30 min, and an increase in the temperature and heating rate reduced the char yield. However, a higher tar yield was achieved at the highest temperature. Experiments on sludge with different moisture contents were also conducted, and the formation of char/tar was inhibited at a higher moisture content. The addition of NaOH and H2O2 can effectively reduce the char and tar yields, respectively. A lumped kinetic model for describing carbon conversion during the hydrothermal gasification of sewage sludge was developed to elucidate the char/tar formation mechanism. The experimental data were used to determine the model parameters, and the fitting results showed that solid–solid conversion from organic matter in sludge was the predominant char/tar formation pathway, with an activation energy of 7.1 kJ/mol. The experiments using the model compounds indicated that humus and protein are the main precursors of char and tar, respectively. This study provides insights for understanding the formation of char/tar from sewage sludge following hydrothermal gasification, which is vital for controlling the formation of char and tar to improve the gasification efficiency.},

The effect of pressure on pyrolysis product yields, syngas composition, properties of tar and char were systematically investigated. The results indicated that the elevated pyrolysis pressure promoted the tar cracking to produce more energy-dense syngas. As for syngas composition, when the pressure was increased from 0.1 MPa to 7.0 MPa, noncombustible CO2 content decreased and simultaneously energy-dense CH4 content increased as well as the lower heating value (LHV) of syngas was greatly increased. According to GC–MS and FTIR results, the quality of tar was greatly improved in terms of high esters, phenols and aromatics contents.

The biochars produced with willow addition and/or in a CO2 atmosphere were characterized by a lower (from 9.0 to 62.8\%)percentage of 3-6-ring PAHs (Ctot)than the biochars derived from sewage sludge alone in N2 atmosphere. The contribution of individual Cfree PAHs did not differ significantly between biochars. The presence of willow during pyrolysis influenced the direction of the changes in the Ctot PAH content depending on the pyrolysis temperature. For SSL alone, regardless of the carrier gas used, the content of Ctot PAHs was observed to decrease with increasing temperature, whereas in the presence of willow temperature did not affect significantly (P ≥ 0.05)the Ctot PAHs content. The change of carrier gas from N2 to CO2 increased the affinity of the biochars to PAHs as confirmed by the distribution coefficients log KTOC.},

	abstract = {The potential energy recovery during sludge activated carbon (SAC) preparation by co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and biomass has recently gained significant attention. This study firstly evaluated the distribution of pyrolysis products including SAC, oils and gases during sludge pyrolysis at different temperatures (400 °C–800 °C) and corncob addition proportions (0–50\%, w/w). The results demonstrated that with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, yield of SAC declined dramatically, while yields of pyrolysis oils and gases increased. With increasing addition of corncob, the yields of SAC and pyrolysis oils declined slightly, while the yield of gases generally increased. Then, the potential energy recovery during sludge pyrolysis was calculated, and the highest energy recovery value was 10.21 kJ/g achieved at 800 °C and 50\% corncob addition. However, higher pyrolysis temperature over 600 °C resulted in lower yield and iodine adsorption capacity of SAC. Therefore, the suitable conditions were suggested to be at 600 °C with 50\% corncob addition considering both adsorption performance of SAC and potential energy recovery efficiency.},

The results show that the presence of metals caused the slight decrease in oil-C (carbon in bio-oil) yield and the increase in gas yield and total carbon yield of aromatics. Ni-loaded HZ has a better performance than Co-loaded one in improving the carbon yield of aromatics, while the maximum yield of 11.2\% was obtained over 0.5Ni-HZ. Metal-loaded HZ promoted the formation of monocyclic aromatics rather than polycyclic aromatics and Ni significantly enhanced the selectivity of benzene. With the addition of Ni and Co, more nitrogen was released as NH3 or fixed in solids. NH3 yield increased by raising the metal loading, and the highest NH3 yield of 36.8\% was obtained over 3.0Ni-HZ. Ni and Co promoted the cracking reactions during CFP to generate more H radicals, which have advantages to the ring-opening of N-containing heterocycles in SS to produce aromatics and NH3. A possible catalytic mechanism of CFP of SS over metal loaded HZ was proposed in this study.},

The thermal analysis results showed that four weight loss zones ({\textless}165, 165–400, 400–600, and {\textgreater}600 °C) were observed in TG curve, and a higher heating rate led to the increase of the maximum devolatilization rate and the higher temperature corresponding to the peak. The activation energy of different heating rate (10, 20, and 30 °C/min) was 70.0, 60.6 and 65.0 kJ/mol, respectively. The FTIR analysis of gaseous products indicated the concentrations of CO2 and CO increased steadily with the increased heating rate, while the concentration of CH4 first increased then decreased. Moreover, the yield of gaseous products and bio-oil increased with the increasing of the heating rate. Finally, the surface structure of chars and the chemical properties of bio-oil obtained were characterized using nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analysis and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.

The effect of the calcined temperature on the reactivity of copper slag was first studied. The results show that the copper slag calcined at 1100 °C (1100CS) exhibits excellent performance for SS gasification. Using 1100CS as an OC, the effect of the mass ratio of OC and SS (OC/SS), steam content, oxygen source and cycle number on the SS CLG were investigated in detail in a fixed bed reactor. OC/SS and steam content are determined at 5 and 33.33\% for obtaining a relatively high carbon conversion and an acceptable energy recovery during the SS CLG, respectively. The 1100CS is similar to steam, which can provide an oxygen source for SS conversion, and it can catalyze the cracking of tar. The conversion of SS undergoes a slight increase with the cycle number due to the prolongation of the gas-solid mean residence time (Rt) and the deposition of alkali or alkaline earth metals on the surface of the OC particles. Phosphorus eventually appears in the form of water-soluble phosphate during the SS CLG, benefiting its recovery. Thus, CLG with 1100CS as an OC is one of good option for sludge treatment.},

	abstract = {Compared with the conventional thermal drying process, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) can reduce the energy cost of water removal from sewage sludge prior to its steam gasification. However, less attention is paid on the interactions between HTC and gasification. In this study, the thermodynamic evaluation on hydrochar gasification performance under different operating conditions including HTC duration (τ), HTC temperature (THTC), gasification temperature (Tg), and steam/hydrochar mass ratio (S/C ratio) is performed. Two indicators including carbon conversion rate (CC) and cold gas efficiency (CGE) are used to assess the gasification performance. The results show that elevating both gasification temperature and S/C ratio can enhance the H2 production, which also result in the increase of CC and CGE. The content and gasification activity of fixed carbon increase under moderate HTC duration and temperature, favoring the H2 formation despite of the apparent loss of volatiles species in the hydrochar. Longer HTC duration or higher HTC temperature declines the H2 production due to the sharp reduction of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, weakening water gas reaction and on-site reforming reaction of tar occurred on the hydrochar surface. In terms of the values of CC = 93.9\% and CGE = 64.38\%, the optimum HTC conditions of τ = 30min and THTC = 200 °C can be determined. The data provided here favor guiding HTC treatment of sewage sludge targeting gasification and thus promoting the development of this promising waste-to-energy technology.},

About 1 kWh electrical power was achieved for approximately 1.2 kg municipal sludge gasified. Most of the heavy metals available in the sludge was found as fixed form in the glassy material. The gasification residues evaluated as valuable materials regarding their characteristics have reuse potential for different beneficial usage alternatives. Based on the costs for the investment and operation and incomes, the return on the investment for this pilot scale system was roughly found as 3.3 years.

This study aims at evaluating the P recovery potential from solid residues obtained from wet air oxidation of SS under subcritical water conditions (WAO residues). A series of P extraction experiments was performed by acidic and alkaline leaching at different liquid to solid ratios. Hot chemical extractions and P fractionations were also carried out to characterize the chemical composition of the WAO residues. The main objectives of this work were to determine the best operating conditions for P extraction, and to describe and understand the kinetics and the main mechanisms leading to P release. The results obtained in this study indicate that 1 M citric acid and 1 M HCl at the liquid to solid ratio of 10 L/kg can extract 61\% and 65\% of the total P content after 2 h of contact time at room temperature, thus giving P extraction capacities of 81 and 86 g P/kg WAO residues, respectively. The analysis of kinetic data indicates that P extraction with 1 M HCl is faster, but 1 M citric acid can give higher P extraction efficiencies at the equilibrium. The molar ratios of Ca to P of the leachates suggest that P extraction from WAO residues was primarily due to the dissolution of a mixture of various Ca-P complexes.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed to develop an integrated treatment of agro-industrial waste for biofuel (biogas and syngas) production and for phosphorus recovery. In the first step, an anaerobic digestion (AD) process was carried out on two different mixtures of raw agro-industrial residues. Specifically, a mixture of asparagus and tomato wastes (mixture-1) and a mixture of potatoes and kiwifruit residues (mixture-2) were investigated. The results proved that the properties of mixtures notably affect the evolution of the digestion process. Indeed, despite the lower organic load, the maximum biogas yield, of about 0.44 L/gCOD removed , was obtained for mixture-1. For mixture-2, the digestion process was hindered by the accumulation of acidity due to the lack of alkalinity in respect to the amount of volatile fatty acids. In the second step, the digestates from AD were utilized for syngas production using supercritical water gasification (SCWG) at 450 °C and 250 bar. Both the digestates were rapidly converted into syngas, which was mainly composed of H 2 , CO 2 , CH 4 , and CO. The maximum values of global gasification efficiency, equal to 56.5 g/kgCOD, and gas yield, equal to 1.8 mol/kgTS, were detected for mixture-2. The last step of the integrated treatment aimed to recover the phosphorus content, in the form of MgKPO 4 ·6H 2 O, from the residual liquid fraction of SCWG. The experimental results proved that at pH = 10 and Mg/P = 1 it is possible to obtain almost complete phosphorus removal. Moreover, by using the scanning electronic microscopy, it was demonstrated that the produced precipitate was effectively composed of magnesium potassium phosphate crystals.},

This study compares the treatment of four dissimilar digestates from anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural residue (AGR); sewage sludge (SS); residual municipal solid waste (MSW), and vegetable, garden, and fruit waste (VGF). HTC experiments were performed at 150, 200 and 250 °C for 1 h using 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% solid loadings of a fixed water mass. The effect of temperature and solid loading to the properties of biocoal and biochemical methane potential (BMP) of process waters are investigated. Results show that the behaviour of digestate during HTC is feedstock dependent and the hydrochar produced is a poor-quality solid fuel. The AGR digestate produced the greatest higher heating value (HHV) of 24 MJ/kg, however its biocoal properties are poor due to slagging and fouling propensities. The SS digestate process water produced the highest amount of biogas at 200 °C and 30\% solid loading. This study concludes that solely treating digestate via HTC enhances biogas production and that hydrochar be investigated for its use as a soil amender.},

	abstract = {The property and release behavior of phosphorus in biochar derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal sludge (EBPR sludge) were investigated. A low-temperature-steam (LTS) activation method was developed to increase the P availability in the biochar. The results demonstrate that the P content in the biochar is comparable to that in typical P fertilizers. The biochar contained a considerable portion of fast-release P. Polyphosphates (poly-P) were the predominant P species in the biochar. LTS greatly improved P availability in biochar produced at 700 °C by hydrolyzing insoluble poly-P to soluble pyro-P and ortho-P. In addition, the presence of Ca2+ could greatly reduce the P-release from biochar produced at lower temperature, e.g. 400 °C, due to that Ca2+ could facilitate the precipitation/adsorption of orthophosohates/pyrophosphates released from the low temperature biochars. Such phenomena was not observed with high temperature biochar, as the soluble poly-P released from 700 °C biochar could complex with Ca2+ rather than precipitated with it. Other environmental conditions, i.e., environmental pH, ionic strength of the soil porewater, and presence of low-molecular-weight acid, only had minor or negligible effects on the P-release of most studied biochars. This study concludes that LTS-activated-700 °C biochar could be a promising P fertilizer given its high, rapid, and unaffected P-release under various environmentally relevant conditions.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of carbon-based nanomaterials, ideally produced via facile, inexpensive approaches, using sustainable resources as precursors, with modulated structures, morphologies and functionalities is still challenging for energy applications. This work developed a mild one-step hydrothermal synthesis route for the fabrication of highly dispersed metallic nickel nanoparticles on hydrothermal carbons derived from waste biomass. The roles of precursor nickel ion concentration and calcination temperature in modulating the morphology, location and crystalline size of the nickel nanoparticles as well as the metal-support interactions have been delineated. The average grain size of the metallic nickel nanocrystals on the resultant Ni0.5@HCOp nanocatalysts could be tuned to 8–13 nm by varying the preparation conditions. The catalytic abilities of the Ni-based nanocatalysts towards hydrogen-rich syngas production and tar reduction were then tested in a two-stage reactor system using sewage sludge as biomass feedstock. The catalytic tests showed that the Ni0.5@HCOp catalyst calcined at 700 °C was shown to have stronger metal-support interactions compared to other Ni-based nanocomposites, which provided better suppression of coke deposition and resistance of nickel agglomeration during the catalytic gasification process. This highly active catalyst promoted formation of hydrogen-rich syngas, with up to 109.2 g H2/kg sludge, and tar yields as low as 2.12 mg g−1.},

In this study, industrial biowastes, including lignocellulosic, non-lignocellulosic and ash-rich types, were selected for HTC experiment under different temperatures. Except for the fuel properties of hydrochar, the evolution in carbonaceous structures was analyzed and compared to that of coals with different ranks (i.e., lignite, bitumite and anthracite); furthermore, these changes were used to establish a correlation with the reactivity of pyrolysis and gasification processes. The results found HTC not only upgraded the fuel quality of feedstock but could also develop their aromatic structures, although each biowaste contained different components. Such improvement simulated the development of coals from low to high ranks because the carbonaceous structure in hydrochars was gradually changed to that of bitumite or even anthracite when HTC temperature increased from 120 °C to 300 °C. TG analysis demonstrated that both of the pyrolysis and gasification reactivity of hydrochar were in a generally negative correlation with HTC temperatures, but the extent and the specific relationship differentiated from each other due to the various components in biowaste. These findings are believed to contribute an essential part in bridging the gap from a theoretical potential energy source to the sustainable development of an alternative renewable fuel.},

	abstract = {Sludge is a by-product of wastewater treatment process with high organic and nitrogen contents. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) rates of refractory species in sludge might be accelerated by reactive alcohols, which is referred to as a co-oxidation phenomenon. In this work, influences of three typical reactive alcohols (methanol, ethanol and isopropanol) on TOC and of NH3–N removal rates of sludge by SCWO were analyzed and their co-oxidation products were characterized by GC–MS, FT–IR, EDS and TG–DTG methods. Additionally, to capture the nature of co-oxidation, HO2[rad] and OH[rad] radicals released by alcohols were theoretically compared with detailed chemical kinetics models using the Chemkin Software. The results show that methanol, ethanol and isopropanol all exhibited co-oxidation accelerated effects on TOC and NH3–N removal rates of sludge. One reason was that alcohols provided reactive HO2[rad] and OH[rad] radicals. The other reason was that adding alcohols not only prevented forming recalcitrant products (non-nitrogen and nitrogen aromatic compounds) but also encouraged producing reactive products (non-nitrogen open chain compounds). Ethanol offered the best co-oxidation promotion effects on the removal of TOC and NH3–N in the liquid products and also gave the lowest organic contents in the solid products, followed by isopropanol and methanol. This order was consistent with the difficulty of how the alcohols themselves could be oxidized in supercritical water since ethanol could support the highest amount of HO2[rad] radicals for sludge in the shortest time.},

	abstract = {Combining anaerobic digestion (AD) and thermochemical/hydrothermal processes is an interesting solution for the treatment and valorisation of agricultural waste. Most of the recent investigations focused on the solid digestate valorisation obtaining syngas and char, the latter for solutions different from land applications. However, there are few investigations based on hydrothermal processes aimed at enhancing the value of liquid digestate. In order to fill this gap, the study aims at verifying the technical feasibility of the combined treatment of AD and supercritical water gasification (SCWG). The experimentation was carried out at a full scale AD plant fed by 110 t/d of buffalo manure (81.8\%) and maize silage (18.2\%). Methodologically, the study first envisaged a bench-scale experimental phase concerning SCWG and then a theoretical phase aimed at quantifying the mass and energy balances with reference to the AD + SCWG and AD schemes. SCWG was examined using a plug flow reactor working at 550 °C and 250 bar for residence times of 20 min. For feed in the range of 4–14 mL/min, it was possible to produce a syngas with a higher heating value (22 MJ/kg organic content) and with a gas yield of about 13 mol/kg of dry-digestate. Carbon gasification and global gasification efficiency were of 35 and 45\%, respectively. Results of the theoretical phase confirmed the energy sustainability of the AD + SCWG scheme although the added value was the production of green chemicals including syringaldehyde (7.6–11.6 kg/d), acetic acid (1.0–6.5 kg/d) and glucose (0.5–5.8 kg/d) with total estimated production in the range 10.2–33.5 kg/d.},

In this perspective, the assessment of the pollutant emissions at pilot scale is necessary. This work compares pollutant emissions from wood and SRF air gasification in a downdraft fixed bed gasifier. Five fuels have been studied: Poplar wood, SRF wood, and three different mixtures containing mass fractions of 80\% SRF wood with 20\% of either tire, plastic waste or sewage sludge. Air gasification was performed in a pilot scale reactor in fed-batch mode using a fuel mass ranging from 5 to 8 kg and an air inlet flow of 170–180 L min−1 (at 0 °C and 101 325 Pa). Depending on the fuel, Equivalence Ratios (ER) ranged from 0.22 to 0.29 and gasification temperatures from 690 to 850 °C. Emissions analyses were performed on product gas, condensable species and remaining chars, with a particular focus on sulfur, nitrogen and heavy metals. Regarding sulfur, wood and SRF wood led to low H2S contents (6–8 μmol mol−1), when SRF mixes led to higher concentrations (44–96 μmol mol−1) in addition to of up to 11 heavier sulfur compounds. Regarding nitrogen, SRF produced higher ammonia concentrations (2.1–7.6 mmol mol−1) than Wood (619 μmol mol−1), as a result of initial nitrogen mass fractions17 to 27 times higher in the SRF mixes. Heavy metals analyzed in remaining solids after gasification showed low recovery rates ({\textless}0.4\%), and tend to accumulate in fine particles, as a result of their volatility.},

Current bio-fuels are predominantly crop-based which require tillable land, fertilizer, chemicals, irrigation, and fuel to cultivate the biomass feedstock. This study investigated the hydrothermal conversion of underutilized waste streams for biomass feedstock. This work blended municipal sewage sludge solids, poultry dissolved air flotation solids, and used cooking oil to form a waste slurry that was thermally converted to renewable fuel products. Blended waste processing provides flexibility and robustness in the future of bio-based fuels, and the authors believe this is the first documented hydrothermal processing of this specific blended waste. The waste slurry was heated under subcritical hydrothermal conditions, where solids were separated, and then heated in a second pressurized reaction to complete the thermal conversion process of wastes to recoverable products. Prior to processing, the blended waste slurry contained 8,490 kJ/kg (3,650 BTU/lb). Following processing, the recovered gas products contained 38,747 kJ/kg (16,658 BTU/lb) and 42\% methane. The recovered renewable oil contained 40,468 kJ/kg (17,398 BTU/lb) and 0.012\% ash. The effluent produced water was appraised for nutrient content and was found to contain 1,689 mg/L of nitrogen, which has potential as a liquid fertilizer product. The produced gas fuel, produced liquid fuel, solid char, and produced nutrient laden water were determined to be potential marketable products.},

	abstract = {Chemical looping gasification (CLG) provides a novel approach to dispose the sewage sludge. In order to improve the reactivity of the calcined copper slag, NiO modification is considered as one of the good solutions. The copper slag calcined at 1100°C doped with 20 wt.\% NiO (Ni20-CS) was used as an oxygen carrier (OC) in sludge CLG in the work. The modification of NiO can evidently enhance the reactivity of copper slag to promote the sludge conversion, especially for sludge char conversion.The carbon conversion and valid gas yield (Vg) increase from 67.02\% and 0.23 m3/kg using the original OC to 78.34\% and 0.29 m3/kg using the Ni20-CS OC, respectively. The increase of equivalent coefficient (Ω) facilitates the sludge conversion and a suitable Ω value is determined at 0.47 to obtain the highest valid gas yield (0.29 m3/kg). A suitable steam content is assigned at 27.22\% to obtain the maximum carbon conversion of 87.09\%, where an acceptable LHV of 12.63 MJ/m3 and Vg of 0.39 m3/kg are obtained. Although the reactivity of Ni20-CS OC gradually decreases with the increase in cycle numbers because of the generation of NiFe2O4-δ species, the deposition of sludge ash containing many metallic elements is beneficial to the sludge conversion. As a result, the carbon conversion shows a slight uptrend with the increase of cycle numbers in sludge CLG. It indicates that the Ni20-CS sample is a good OC for sludge CLG.},

The energy potential was evaluated through a series of thermal co-processing tests of disaggregated and pelletized mixtures. Due to their differing fixed-carbon-to-volatile-material ratios, combining the ISRs resulted in a reduction of up to 45\% of the mass of the ISR generated, improving the disposal conditions and achieving a minimum thermal power of 5.0 MJ/Nm3 through gasification.

The experiments were performed at continuous counter-feed of sludge-lignin (without and with the addition of Na2CO3) and SCW or SCW/O2 fluid under temperature gradient along the axis of a vertically arranged reactor (425 °C at the top, and 600 °C at the bottom) at a pressure of 30 MPa. To get the temperature dependencies of the yield of the product, sludge-lignin gasification was also carried out by pumping water vapor and SCW through its bed at the uniform (1.5 °C/min) heating of the reactor up to 650 °C. In SCW gasification products, along with H2, CO, CO2, and hydrocarbons, toxic S-, Cl-, N-, and O-containing substances were detected. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons and heteroatomic substances during SCW gasification in counter-current flows was greater than at pumping SCW through a sludge-lignin bed. It was revealed that the addition of Na2CO3 to the sludge-lignin at the counter-feed of SCW leads to an increase in the yield of combustible gases, as well as to a decrease in the yield of CO, phenols, and carbonized residue. The addition of Na2CO3 to the sludge-lignin intensifies the oxidation of its organic components in SCW/O2 fluid. It was established that the bulk of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids resulted from the oxidation of Cl- and S-containing organic components of sludge-lignin in SCW/O2 fluid are neutralized by sodium carbonate with the formation of NaCl and Na4(CO3)0.61(SO4)1.39, respectively.},

	abstract = {Biological syntrophy can be defined as a nutritional condition where various syntrophic microorganisms mutually synergize their metabolic activities to break down complex organic substrates that cannot be otherwise catabolized by either individually. Direct interspecies electrons transfer (DIET) is a syntrophic metabolism wherein free electrons flow from one cell to another through shared physical, electrical connections without the requirement of reduced electron carriers (redox mediators) like molecular hydrogen or formate or protein released after cell death. In anaerobic digestion (AD), the transfer of electrons between two different syntrophic microbial communities such as bacteria and archaea is a vital process for methanogens to get control of energy barriers and catabolize complex organics which could not be digested by them alone. Studies conducted so far show that DIET can be accelerated by conductive materials like carbon nanotubes, biochar, carbon cloth, granular activated carbon (GAC), and magnetite. The conductive materials mediated DIET has showed to be highly efficient in enhancement of methane yield than indirect interspecies electron transfer (IIET) in case of conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) process. This review summarizes the studies conducted to date on the effect of conductive materials mediated DIET on methanogenesis in the AD. The different types and concentrations of conducting materials affecting (a) DIET, (b) major microbial communities required for carrying out DIET, and (c) the rate of methanation, are critically discussed in the review.},

Besides its obvious role in publishing , uncertainty analysis provides the experimenter a rational way of evaluating the significance of the scatter on repeated trials. This can be a powerful tool in locating the source of trouble in a misbehaving experiment. To the user of the data, a statement (by the experimenter) of the range within which the results of the present experiment might have fallen by chance alone is of great help in deciding whether the present data agree with past results or differ from them. These benefits can be realized only if both the experimenter and the reader understand what an uncertainty analysis is, what it can do (and cannot do), and how to interpret its results. This paper begins with a general description of the sources of errors in engineering measurements and the relationship between error and uncertainty. Then the path of an uncertainty analysis is traced from its first step, identifying the intended true value of a measurement, through the quantitative estimation of the individual errors, to the end objective-the interpretation and reporting of the results. The basic mathematics of both single-sample and multiple-sample analysis are presented, as well as a technique for numerically executing uncertainty analyses when computerized data interpretation is involved.

This will have greater impact on future hydrogen production project designs and developing new ap- proaches to reduce the overall production costs to make it as cheaper fuel. The sensitivity analysis of various hydrogen production process such as pyrolysis, gasification, steam reforming of natural gas, dark fermentation, photobiolysis, water electrolysis and renewable liquid reforming were reviewed to evaluate their merits and demerits along with cost-effectiveness. On economic view point, steam reforming of natural gas is efficient, low cost and best methods for hydrogen production. A future research is required to reduce energy input and trapping carbon dioxide emission using membrane models.},

The objective of this work was to develop an empirical equation to describe the calorific value of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste as a function of its elemental composition. The MSW components were grouped into paper wastes, food wastes, yard wastes and plastics. Sample sizes ranged from 0.2 to 0.5kg. In addition to the above individual components, commingled municipal solid wastes were sampled from a bio-drying facility located in Crete (sample sizes ranged from 8 to 15kg) and were analyzed for the same parameters. Based on the results of this work, an improved empirical model was developed that revealed that carbon, hydrogen and oxygen were the only statistically significant predictors of calorific value. Total organic carbon was statistically similar to total carbon for most materials in this work. The carbon to organic matter ratio of 26 municipal solid waste substrates and of 18 organic composts varied from 0.40 to 0.99. An approximate chemical empirical formula calculated for the organic fraction of commingled municipal solid wastes was C 32NH 55O 16. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Performances are evaluated by proprietary software developed at Politecnico di Milano and compared on the basis of a coherent set of assumptions. Since the two gasification technologies are configured as "two-step oxidation" processes, their energy performances are very similar to those of conventional plants. The potential benefits that may justify their adoption relate to material recovery and operation/emission control: recovery of metals in non-oxidized form; collection of ashes in inert, vitrified form; combustion control; lower generation of some pollutants. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Tar formation is one of the major problems to deal with during biomass gasification. Tar condenses at reduced temperature, thus blocking and fouling process equipments such as engines and turbines. Considerable efforts have been directed on tar removal from fuel gas. Tar removal technologies can broadly be divided into two approaches; hot gas cleaning after the gasifier (secondary methods), and treatments inside the gasifier (primary methods). Although secondary methods are proven to be effective, treatments inside the gasifier are gaining much attention as these may eliminate the need for downstream cleanup. In primary treatment, the gasifier is optimized to produce a fuel gas with minimum tar concentration. The different approaches of primary treatment are (a) proper selection of operating parameters, (b) use of bed additive/catalyst, and (c) gasifier modifications. The operating parameters such as temperature, gasifying agent, equivalence ratio, residence time, etc. play an important role in formation and decomposition of tar. There is a potential of using some active bed additives such as dolomite, olivine, char, etc. inside the gasifier. Ni-based catalyst are reported to be very effective not only for tar reduction, but also for decreasing the amount of nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia. Also, reactor modification can improve the quality of the product gas. The concepts of two-stage gasification and secondary air injection in the gasifier are of prime importance. Some aspects of primary methods and the research and development in this area are reviewed and cited in the present paper. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The effects of reaction temperature and water-soluble additives as catalysts on gasification were examined. The resultant products, including syngas, hydrochar and liquid residues were characterized. The rise of temperature without the presence of catalysts increased the yield of H2 (0.06 (350 ?C) to 1.91 mol/kg (450 ?C) and enhanced the gasification efficiency (1.29e19.61\%), and decreased total organic carbon (TOC) by 68.50\% in liquid residue. The changes in product distribution and characteristics of hydrochar and liquid residue implied that the organic matters in sewage sludge were dissolved and hydrolyzed in sub- and supercritical water, resulting in the production of syngas. The catalytic effect of different catalysts in relation to the H2 gas yield was in the following order: KOH {\textgreater} NaOH {\textgreater} Na2CO3 z K2CO3. In the case of catalytic supercritical water gasification at 400 ?C, the highest molar fraction (37.28\%) and yield of H2 (1.60 mol/kg) were obtained in the presence of KOH. Furthermore, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that a conversion and disso- lution of the organic matters in sewage sludge to liquid and gas, produced a porous, fragmented structure and disintegrated surface of hydrochar.},

The presence of HA in the sludge increased the yields of H2 and CO compared to that from the raw sludge pyrolysis. Water evolved during decomposition of kaolin promoted the water-gas shift reaction resulting in less CO in the gas phase. The presence of CaO in the sludge had a major influence on CO2 sequestration reducing the volume of non-condensable gas by 18\% compared to that from the raw sludge pyrolysis. In contrast, CO volume increased due to the induced Boudouard reaction. No significant impact on the distribution of the chemical compounds in the organic or aqueous phase was observed with the addition of HA to the sludge. Among the inorganic additives, CaO catalysed deoxygenation and ring opening reactions leading to an increment of aliphatic compounds in the organic phase of tar while kaolin did not show any significant impact. HA in sludge increased the carbon content in the derived char to 35.2\% compared to that in the char derived from the raw sludge (31.0\%). In contrast, kaolin and CaO resulted in higher char yields with lower carbon contents due to high ash content in the raw samples. Regarding heavy metals fate, the addition of HA and CaO to the sludge effectively immobilised heavy metals in the derived char while kaolin appeared to be less effective.},

This study investigates the effects of the gasification temperature, moisture content, and reaction atmosphere on the evolution of sulfur-containing compounds. The results showed that temperature was the key parameter causing the migration of sulfur from sludge to biogas and liquid products. The sludge decomposition reaction was dominated by ionic reactions at 360 °C, while the decomposition of organic matter was converted to free radical reactions as the temperature increased from 380 °C to 440 °C. The mercaptan and thioether contents of the bio-oil decreased to 0.3\% at 440 °C. Correspondingly, the concentration of H2S increased from 6.7 ppm to 38.0 ppm. The decomposition of organic sulfur with an unstable structure (S-H bond and S-C bond) was the main cause of the increase in the content of H2S. Additionally, the solubility and oxidation properties of supercritical water were extremely strong. Some sulfur-containing organic compounds were converted into SO42- via hydrolysis and oxidation reactions, forming sulfate crystals with heavy metals in the bio-char, which aided in achieving the synergistic immobilization of sulfur and heavy metals.},

	abstract = {Efficient transformation of sewage sludge into bioenergy is currently a promising option to combat the energy crisis and mitigate climate change. Most attention has been paid to thermochemical H2 production, however, effective approaches to utilize the carbon in sludge are lacking. Here we propose a novel two-stage sorption-enhanced thermochemical conversion process, which relies on the integration of a CaO-based CO2 carrying cycle, to intensify the utilization of sludge carbon. In the process, the CO2 generated during sludge pyrolysis at the first stage is captured and stored in the form of CaCO3, and is then released at higher temperatures (the second stage) to gasify the sludge char for CO production. Under the conditions investigated in this study, the proposed process could produce 284.7 NmL of syngas per gram of dry sludge with a gross CO/H2 molar ratio of 2.3, via obtaining a H2-rich gas stream at 550 °C and a CO-rich gas stream at 750 °C, respectively. We conclude that the proposed process offers an efficient option for the production of syngas from sewage sludge with significantly intensified carbon utilization.},

The present work explored the production, management and policies adopted in the treatment of relevant typologies of solid wastes in Portugal, in particular, municipal solid wastes and construction and demolition wastes and sewage sludge, and tried to quantify the energetic potential that can be achieved through gasification processes. In addition, a techno-economic study to evaluate the feasibility of the construction and operation of a small-scale gasification plant was also developed. Results indicated that there are various methods which are considered more sustainable for the treatment of such wastes like bio-digestion, pyrolysis and gasification, and which may replace the current techniques of incineration or landfilling that are largely adopted but have caused a number of problems to communities and also to the environment. It was identified a huge potential to valorise these wastes to obtain electricity through gasification, since a significant portion of them are currently disposed of or eliminated in inadequate ways. The economic analysis revealed that it is possible to implement a small-scale gasification plant with financial viability and possible attractive economic results for investors. Construction of these units located in strategic points over the country may contribute for a more sustainable treatment and valorisation of solid wastes.},

Results indicated that favoring by increased pH in the process water, HTC temperature played a significant role in the migration and transformation of P during HTC. Therefore, higher HTC temperature was beneficial for P enrichment and transformation to apatite phosphorus in the hydrochars. Both alkaline environment and existence of sufficient calcium ions were essential for enhanced formation of apatite phosphorus during HTC. Adding CaO could stimulate almost complete transformation of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus to apatite phosphorus such as hydroxyapatite, causing a maximum increase of apatite phosphorus by 252\%. Concurrently, P-bioavailability by 2\% (w/w) formic acid extraction of the hydrochars increased by 233\% at CaO = 4\%. These findings were confirmed by XRD analyses. Ca-associated apatite phosphorus such as Ca5(PO4)3OH and Ca2P2O7 ∙ 2H2O, was detected in the hydrochars. With the assistance of thermochemical calculation, transformation pathways of P after CaO addition have been proposed, which coincided with our experimental results well. The stable P-containing minerals of hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH) was calculated at equilibrium state.},

The effects of temperature, retention time, and the oxidation coefficient on gas composition, gas yield, total organic carbon removal efficiency (XTOC), gasification efficiency (GE), carbon gasification efficiency (CE), and phosphorus release rate (Xp) were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the yields for hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide increased with the increase in temperature from 380 °C to 460 °C. A maximum hydrogen molar fraction of 55.72\% and a yield of 19.86 mol/kg were obtained at 460 °C and 27 MPa after 6 min. The GE, CE, XTOC, and Xp also increased with the increase in temperature. An extension of the retention time promoted the gasification of sludge, thereby resulting in an increase in the hydrogen and methane molar fraction, yield, GE, CE, XTOC, and Xp. Under the conditions of 420 °C and 27 MPa after 6 min, with an increase in the oxidation coefficient from 1.5 to 2.5, the oxidation reaction became dominant in the supercritical water. Hydrogen and methane were converted to carbon dioxide and water with an excess of hydrogen peroxide, which resulted in a lower hydrogen yield. However, the decomposition of organic compounds in the sludge was promoted with the addition of hydrogen peroxide, thereby resulting in an increase in the GE, CE, XTOC, and Xp. When the oxidation coefficient reached 2.5, a maximum GE of 131.6\% and Xp of 98.74\% were obtained.},

In this paper, hydrothermal carbonization coupled with mechanical compression in situ for sewage sludge dewatering has been proposed as state-of-the-art method. Different operating modes and conditions (temperature, residence time, and mechanical pressure) of hydrothermal pretreatment were investigated. The results showed that mechanical compression in situ under hot condition has revealed a significant benefit compared with other modes, resulted in a reduction of 27.7–59.6％of the moisture content. After hydrothermal pretreatment at temperatures of 160–240 °C, the moisture content decreased about 30–60\% and the solid yield decreased from 94.2\% to 61.8\% within 60 min. The HHV of hydrochar increased about 11.25\% while the HHV for pressed hydrochar showed a decrease of 9.98–42.16\% after in situ mechanical compression. Moreover, a kinetic model was presented based on the lumped components. The measured and the simulated masses are in a good arrangement. The average weighted absolute difference is 3.53\%, while the average absolute difference is 1.08 g with parameter values k 0 = 8004.5 min −1 and E a = 31,506 J/mol. This new method is applicable to achieve pressed hydrochar with higher solid contents in contrast to the other drying methods.},

Typical tar removal apparatuses, such as scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators, were not employed and the only tar removal agent used was coal-based active carbon. The hydrogen content of all producer gases was remarkably high, whereas the tar content was low (maximum H2: 29 vol\%; minimum tar: 0 mg/Nm3). The producer gases from the pilot-scale experiment also exhibited an exceedingly high hydrogen content and low tar content (maximum H2: 27 vol\%; minimum tar: 3.3 mg/Nm3). The pilot-scale operation continued without any external heat supply via autothermal operation. A gas engine was connected to the pilot-scale gasification plant to generate electricity. The generated power ranged from 20 to 35 kWe depending on the type of biomass used. This indicated that the two-stage gasification process could be applied to decentralized power generation. To summarize, the present study provided positive experimental results of the two-stage gasification process in terms of tar reduction, hydrogen production, and power generation.

	abstract = {Syngas, a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), has attracted increasing attention since it is a versatile and flexible platform feedstock for the production of value-added chemicals and fuels via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Syngas production from biomass gasification has been widely investigated, while the lack of tunable H2/CO ratio in the syngas limits the direct industrial application of biomass-derived syngas. By incorporation of steam gasification into the first stage of the two-stage sorption-enhanced steam gasification (SESG) of sewage sludge (SS), the H2/CO ratio of produced syngas is tunable from 0.9 to 4.7 by controlling the CaO and steam contents. The SS sample with a CaO/SS mass ratio of 3:7 produces an H2-rich gas stream (72.2 vol\% purity) at the first stage (550 °C) and CO-rich gas stream (60.5 vol\% purity) at the subsequent second stage (750 °C), providing a new promising approach to directly integrate the two-stage SESG of biomass with the syngas application where H2 and CO could be mixed in desirable ratios for the downstream synthesis of value-added chemicals and fuels. The high distribution of carbon and hydrogen in the tar indicates that the two-stage SESG has a great potential to promote the decomposition of tar for enhanced syngas production.},

Several efforts are being made currently not only to safely dispose of sewage sludge but also to utilize it as an energy source. Therefore, in this study, initiatives were taken to valorize sewage sludge cake by reducing the moisture content and increasing the calorific value by applying a hydrothermal treatment technique for efficient energy recovery. The sludge cake treated at 200 °C for 1 h was found to be the optimum condition for hydrothermal carbonization, as, in this condition, the caloric value of the treated sludge increased by 10\% and the moisture content removed was 20 wt.\%. To recover energy from the hydrothermally treated sludge, a gasification technology was applied at 900 °C. The results showed that the product gas from hydrothermally treated sludge cake had a higher lower heating value (0.98 MJ/Nm3) and higher cold gas efficiency (5.8\%). Furthermore, compared with raw sludge cake, less tar was generated during the gasification of hydrothermally treated sludge cake. The removal efficiency was 28.2\%. Overall results depict that hydrothermally treated sewage sludge cake could be a good source of energy recovery via the gasification process.},

However, with rise in energy demand, petrochemical production has also increased, consequently generating complex waste during onshore and offshore exploration, refining, and production of oil. Petrochemical industries are the major source of organic and inorganic toxic pollutants. Organic pollutants primarily consist of complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and are mutagenic, carcinogenic, persistent in environment, and cause adverse affects on the environment and human health. These pollutants are major source of esthetic pollution and ecological disturbance in aquatic life because of their toxicity. Various chemical methods are applied for the removal of these pollutants because of the production of secondary pollutants. Thus, biological techniques are emphasized as ecological sustainable approach. Use of biological technologies in bioremediation is still in developing stages of research. In spite of great success in ex situ conditions, field-based studies are needed for appropriate technology implementation in environmental conditions. In bioremediation, use of bacteria and bacterial consortium was very well used with many advance applications. Mycoremediation (fungal treatment) method and its potential for PAHs removal is infancy. This chapter focuses on use of different fungal strains for the removal of PAHs. The metabolic, cellular, and molecular functioning of fungi has also been discussed in relation to PAHs. A brief discussion on recent trends and methods related to enzymology and fungal pelletization is included for the better understanding of the current research scenario in the field of mycoremediation.},

Incineration, the most widely used method, is difficult to implement in low populated areas because it requires a large amount of waste to be viable (100,000 tons per year). This paper analyses the economic and environmental costs of different MSW-to-Energy technologies (WtE) in an area comprising of 13 municipalities in southern Spain. We analyse anaerobic digestion (Biomethanization), the production of solid recovered fuel (SRF) and gasification, and compare these approaches to the present Biological Mechanical Treatment (BMT) with elimination of the reject in landfill, and incineration with energy recovery. From an economic standpoint the implementation of WtE systems reduces the cost of running present BMT systems and incineration; gasification presents the lowest value. From the environmental standpoint, Life Cycle Assessment shows that any WtE alternatives, including incineration, present important advantages for the environment when compared to BMT. Finally, in order to select the best alternative, a multi-criteria method is applied, showing that anaerobic digestion is the optimal solution for the area studied.},

The increasing amount of solid waste arising from municipalities and other sources and its consequent disposal have been the major environmental and economic problems in Turkey. Furthermore, providing more effective and eco-friendly solutions has been a key point for Turkey while being a candidate country for European Union (EU) accession. In this paper, a brief overview on recent technologies and methods applied to MSW management in the world is presented. Current research studies accessed on the literature on MSW are outlined.

Thermodynamic analysis is based on the assumption that the gasification reactions take place at the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, without regard to the reactor and process characteristics. First, model components of MSW including food, green wastes, paper, textiles, rubber, chlorine-free plastic, and polyvinyl chloride were chosen as the feedstock of a steam gasification process, with the steam temperature ranging from 973 K to 2273 K and the steam-to-MSW ratio (STMR) ranging from 1 to 5. It was found that the effect of the STMR on the gasification performance was almost the same as that of the steam temperature. All the differences among the seven types of MSW were caused by the variation of their compositions. Next, the gasification of actual MSW was analyzed using this thermodynamic equilibrium model. It was possible to count the inorganic components of actual MSW as silicon dioxide or aluminum oxide for the purpose of simplification, due to the fact that the inorganic components mainly affected the reactor temperature. A detailed comparison was made of the composition of the gaseous products obtained using steam, hydrogen, and air gasifying agents to provide basic knowledge regarding the appropriate choice of gasifying agent in MSW treatment upon demand.},

It has been validated with published experimental data from different authors for downdraft, fluidized-bed gasifiers and different biomasses, showing good agreement between reported data and modeled values.

The effects of temperature, pressure, steam biomass ratio (SBR) and equivalence ratio (ER) on the equilibrium hydrogen yield were studied. Gibbs energy minimization approach was used to determine the product gas composition. Wood (designated by CH 1.5 O 0.7) was used as the model biomass compound and Stanjan (v 3.93L) software was used. Gasifier, the most critical component of any biomass gasification system, was modeled as an equilibrium reactor and the energy consumption and thermodynamic efficiency were determined. A first law analysis of the gasifier showed that the optimum conditions for hydrogen production occurred at a gasification temperature of 1000 K, SBR of 3, ER of 0.1. Finally, equilibrium calculations were compared with experimental data from literature which showed that for high gas residence times and high gasification temperatures there is a close match of equilibrium results with experimental ones.},

	abstract = {Biomass gasification is widely recognized as an effective method to obtain renewable energy. To accurately predict the syngas and tar compositions is a challenge. A chemical reaction kinetics model based on comprehensive gasification kinetics is proposed to simulate downdraft biomass gasification. The kinetic model is validated by direct comparison to experimental results of two downdraft gasifiers available in the literature and is found to be more accurate than the widely used Gibbs energy-minimizing model (GEM model). The kinetic model is then applied to investigate the effects of equivalence ratio (ER), gasification temperature, biomass moisture content, and biomass composition on syngas and tar production. Accurate water-gas shift and CO shift reaction kinetics are found critical to achieve good agreement with experimental results.},

The major components are plastic (PE and PP), food and kitchen waste, and paper, whereas the minor components are textile, rubber, and biomass. Reactions were conducted in small drop tube fixed bed reactor with isothermal reaction temperature at 700, 800, and 900 °C. Steam was supplied as the gasifying agent for the main purpose of producing hydrogen-rich gas. Pyrolysis was also conducted at the same condition to observe the characteristic differences. Producer gas, including H2, CH4, and CO, of both the reactions was a function of the temperature, whereas CO2 showed a reversed trend when the reaction temperature was increased. Simple kinetic models of those gaseous formations were studied for describing the related parameters. It is challenging to determine the kinetics of the individual gas generation while most kinetic studies have focused on mass deterioration. The commonly used kinetic model of nucleation of Avrami–Erofe'ev (A2) could well predict the mechanism of the gas formation of gasification. In parallel, the pyrolysis conformed to the A3 model due to the slower rate of char and tar decomposition when the gasifying agent was absent. The activation energy of each gaseous species and the fitting of experimental data with the selected models are examined in this study.},

The steam gasification characteristics and kinetics of five different municipal solid waste chars had been investigated by the method of isothermal thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the gasification reactivity increased with gasification temperature. Effect of H/C and O/C ratios, ash composition and particle pore structure of chars on gasification reactivity were studied, which illustrated that the H/C and O/C ratios and ash composition had great influence on gasification reactivity and the pore structure cannot explain well in this study. A homogeneous model, unreacted shrinking core model and random pore model were employed to describe the kinetic behavior of different chars, and the kinetic parameters were also obtained. Finally, through the evaluation of the three kinetic models by comparing the experimental data with the fitted results, the random pore model was determined to perform best. This study should, therefore, be of some value to solid waste gasification industrialization.},

It has been widely used to convert coal into gaseous energy carriers but only has been recently looked at as a process for producing energy from biomass. This study explores the potential of gasification for energy production and treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW). It relies on adapting the theory governing the chemistry and kinetics of the gasification process to the use of MSW as a feedstock to the process. It also relies on an equilibrium kinetics and thermodynamics solver tool (Gasify®) in the process of modeling gasification of MSW. The effect of process temperature variation on gasifying MSW was explored and the results were compared to incineration as an alternative to gasification of MSW. Also, the assessment was performed comparatively for gasification of MSW in the United Arab Emirates, USA, and Thailand, presenting a spectrum of socioeconomic settings with varying MSW compositions in order to explore the effect of MSW composition variance on the products of gasification. All in all, this study provides an insight into the potential of gasification for the treatment of MSW and as a waste to energy alternative to incineration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We examine the redox activity of nickel/nickel oxide foils. Thin nickel foils (2.5 µm, 10 µm, and 100 µm) were subjected to redox conditions in a fixed-bed reactor within 800–1000 °C, and samples were examined using SEM at different stages of conversion. We identify some key features or the process that are used to guide model development: (1) Oxidation starts with the nucleation of oxide grains, followed by their rapid growth leading to overlap and the attenuation of fast diffusion pathways. (2) Reduction is impacted by the evolution of macro-pores which facilitate gas-oxide contact, and dense metallic clusters that shield the reactants. (3) The transitions between stages during conversion and the characteristics of grains, pores and clusters depend on the sample thickness. Guided by these observations, analytical models are formulated. Oxidation is modeled as a nucleation nucleation-growth process while reduction is characterized by an adsorption-surface reaction process. We extract the corresponding reaction parameters by training the model using the measurements and show that the model formulation captures the controlling mechanisms of the conversion. The oxidation rate is controlled by the rapid decay of oxygen transport across the products layer, and the dependency of the oxides grain structure on the sample thickness contributes to the rate of decay. The reduction rate is largely controlled by the accessibility of lattice oxygen to surface kinetics, and mostly by slow ionic diffusion. While using different foil thicknesses is useful in extracting the kinetics, if used in rapid redox processes applicable to chemical-looping applications, oxygen carriers (foils or other forms) with characteristic active metal thickness of ∼1 µm are recommended.},

The data demonstrate the detrimental effect on catalytic properties (1) occurs at HBr concentrations above 500 ppmv, (2) is more severe compared to HCl and (3) varies greatly with the catalyst structure. The characterization of spent catalysts revealed that the formation of chemisorbed Ni-Br species, enhanced Ni sintering and depletion of NiO-Al2O3 sites could be the reasons for the loss of tar reforming and water-gas shift activities. On the other hand, no significant effect of HBr on catalyst coking was observed. The comparison of different catalysts demonstrated that the negative HBr impact can be successfully mitigated by developing a nanostructured catalyst with high porosity and Ni dispersion that ensure the strong Ni-support interaction.},

Thermochemical and biochemical routes have been compared. Three alternative gasification technologies have been considered together with anaerobic digestion. For the reforming stage, two alternatives have been compared: autothermal and steam reforming. Finally, ammonia is synthesized in a multibed reactor with two different configurations: direct or indirect cooling. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program but solved as a set of 14 nonlinear programs. Indirect gasifier followed by steam methane reforming and direct cooling ammonia reactor is the path that presents the best performance with an ammonia production cost of about 380 €/t. The biochemical route shows worse results to ammonia due to the low yield to biogas and, therefore, to ammonia.},

These problems led to serious public concerns, which in turn resulted in political actions aiming to reduce the amount of wastes reaching the environment. These actions aim to promote sustainable waste management solutions. The main objective of these policies is to promote the recycling of municipal solid waste and the conversion of waste to energy and valuable chemicals. These conversions can be performed using either biological (e.g., anaerobic digestion) or thermochemical processes (e.g., pyrolysis). Research efforts during the last years have been fruitful, and many publications demonstrated the effective conversation of municipal solid waste to energy and chemicals. These processes are discussed in the current review article together with the change of the waste policy that was implemented in the EU during the last years.},

Key performance indicators of methanol production via conventional and CO2 hydrogenation routes are compared. The results suggest that the methanol production rate with an inlet H2/CO2 of 3 is ca. 59 \% greater than the case with the inlet H2/CO2 composition of 2. The overall hydrogen and CO2 conversion of the cases with the inlet H2/CO2 of 3 is greater than the reactor system with the inlet H2/CO2 of 2. For each objective function criteria, the analysis shows that increasing the H2/CO2 to the methanol reactor increases the natural gas consumption in the conventional route and the higher the inlet H2/CO2 ratio, the higher the CO2 emission is. If the inlet hydrogen is produced via water electrolysis, the CO2 emission of the CO2 hydrogenation process route will be negative.},

High-temperature conversion of waste in syngas is the main step of the Waste-to-Methanol process. Unfortunately, produced syngas does not directly comply with the requirements for methanol synthesis, in that syngas purification and conditioning steps are required. Moreover, waste, due to its heterogeneous nature, presents a variable composition, leading to the production of variable syngas flowrate and composition. A thermodynamic equilibrium model of gasification unit has been developed in Aspen Plus environment and applied to analyse the effects of feedstock variability; RDF composition has been characterized considering as main parameters: ash, moisture and combustible fractions, carbon to hydrogen and carbon to oxygen ratios, and Lower Heating Value. Then, a simplified simulation of downstream process has been introduced to evaluate the influence of waste composition on overall methanol production. The present study allows the identification of the main parameters affecting the syngas and, accordingly, overall process yield, consumptions and emissions.},

In fact, the product gas composition resulting from the presence of the aforesaid polymeric wastes in the fuel blend is such that the gas from the steam reforming unit does not need to be further conditioned in a water-gas shift reactor; the sole carbon dioxide capture process is sufficient to meet the requirements for the downstream methanol production.

	abstract = {The importance of statistically designed experiments in industry has been well recognized. However, the use of 'design of experiments' is still not pervasive, owing in part to the inefficient learning process experienced by many non-statisticians. In this paper, the nature of design of experiments, in contrast to the usual statistical process control techniques, is discussed. It is then pointed out that for design of experiments to be appreciated and applied, appropriate approaches should be taken in training, learning and application. Perspectives based on the concepts of objective setting and design under constraints can be used to facilitate the experimenters' formulation of plans for collection, analysis and interpretation of empirical information. A review is made of the expanding role of design of experiments in the past several decades, with comparisons made of the various formats and contexts of experimental design applications, such as Taguchi methods and Six Sigma. The trend of development shows that, from the realm of scientific research to business improvement, the competitive advantage offered by design of experiments is being increasingly felt.},

	abstract = {Efficient testing of design prototypes or early batches of products is essential to meeting time-to-market as well as field performance and other requirements such as those specified in environmental and safety standards. Most design engineers are concerned with the technical arrangements and execution of such tests but may not be making use of an approach based on information transformation that is better known to statisticians in the form of experimental design. In this paper, we suggest the use of strategies and tools of experimental design from the perspective of information utilization, and highlight ways in which specific performance characteristics of a new or improved product can be effectively and efficiency tested, quantified, and evaluated. The approach also bridges the usual gap that exists between design engineers and mathematical statisticians, as traditionally each profession tends to have its own parlance and mindset in empirical studies. The techniques illustrated in this paper tend to "fall through the crack" in various texts on empirical product testing; they help put in place a framework that can be fruitfully adopted by design engineers who do not necessarily have an extensive background in statistics. Knowledge of this framework is essential today when on one hand, time for product development, testing and evaluation is short in a globalized market, while on the other is the prevalence of computing hardware and software that has virtually eliminated the chores of data-crunching arising from product evaluation and proofing activities.

	abstract = {Factorial design was used to investigate the parameters involved in co-digestion mixture of dairy wastes (from a Moroccan dairy industry) in order to improve methane production of this mixture. Indeed, evaluation of methane yield as a function of three parameters (pH, inoculum and organic load) showed the correlation between the experimental and statistical data in terms of pH 8 and inoculum 1 (constituted by sludge diluted in 1 L of basal medium of methanogenic bacteria, in addition to formic acid (5 mL L−1), propionic acid (5 mL L−1), lactic acid (5 mL L−1) and micro-nutrient (10 mL L−1)) as optimum parameters. However, a discrepancy was detected about organic load. The interaction between parameters had a positive effect on methane yield because it led to produce experimentally a maximum methane using the higher load (3.44 g VS). These results allow selecting the parameters for the improvement of methane production. Furthermore, the validity of the fitting model to describe and improve the efficiency of dairy wastes co-digestion was investigated. In addition, an abatement of 89\% of volatile solids was observed and the mineral solids was increased from 4 to 7.2 g L−1, which is important of digestat value as fertilizer.},

Mixtures consisting of sewage sludge with cow dung and garden waste were studied with set A, whereas mixtures consisting of sewage sludge with cow dung and fruit juice wastewater were studied with set B. Augmented simplex centroid design was used to design the mixture composition for the anaerobic co-digestion. The reactor performance was assessed using cumulative methane volume and percentage volatile solids destruction as the criteria. Synergetic effect was found to be 9.71\% of garden waste (GW), 20.29\% of cow dung (CD) and 70\% of sewage sludge (SS) in set A and 75.5\% of SS and 24.5\% of CD in set B. Antagonism was observed with the mixes containing garden and fruit juice wastewater (FJW) with the SS. The reason may be due to the rapid acidification of FJW which leads to the soaring of the reactor. In case of GW, the substrate was limiting and the biogas production was negligible after 10th day. Response surface methods were used to find out optimum mixture combination for maximising the biogas production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The development of biofuels has been considered as an important countermeasure to abate anthropogenic CO2 emissions, suppress deteriorated atmospheric greenhouse effect, and mitigate global warming. To produce biofuels from biomass, thermochemical conversion processes are considered as the most efficient routes wherein torrefaction has the lowest global warming potential. Combustion is the easiest way to consume biomass, which can be burned alone or co-fired with coal to generate heat and power. However, solid biomass fuels are not commonly applied in the industry due to their characteristics of hygroscopic nature and high moisture content, low bulk density and calorific value, poor grindability, low compositional homogeneity, and lower resistance against biological degradation. In recently developing biomass conversion technologies, torrefaction has attracted much attention since it can effectively upgrade solid biomass and produce coal-like fuel. Torrefaction is categorized into dry and wet torrefaction; the former can further be split into non-oxidative and oxidative torrefaction. Despite numerous methods developed, non-oxidative torrefaction, normally termed torrefaction, has a higher potential for practical applications and commercialization when compared to other methods. To provide a comprehensive review of the progress in biomass torrefaction technologies, this study aims to perform an in-depth literature survey of torrefaction principles, processes, systems, and to identify a current trend in practical torrefaction development and environmental performance. Moreover, the encountered challenges and perspectives from torrefaction development are underlined. This state-of-the-art review is conducive to the production and applications of biochar for resource utilization and environmental sustainability. To date, several kinds of reactors have been developed, while there is still no obviously preferred one as they simultaneously have pros and cons. Integrating torrefaction with other processes such as co-firing, gasification, pyrolysis, and ironmaking, etc., makes it more efficient and economically feasible in contrast to using a single process. By virtue of capturing carbon dioxide during the growth stage of biomass, negative carbon emissions can even be achieved from torrefied biomass.},

	abstract = {Industrial success requires efficient experimentation both for the improvement of existing products and processes and for development of new ones. Because results are usually known quickly, the natural way to experiment is to use information from each group of runs to plan the next. Such investigation employs a scientific paradigm in which data drives an alternation of induction and deduction. This process can suggest at each stage how questions that are still at issue can be resolved. Response surface methods are a group of statistical techniques specifically designed to catalyze scientific learning of this kind. In this paper, the scientific paradigm for discovery and sequential learning is contrasted with the mathematical paradigm for the proof of theorems. It is argued that, because statistical training unduly emphasizes mathematics at the expense of science, confusion between the two paradigms occurs. This has resulted in emphasis on the development and use of "one-shot" statistical procedures which mimic the mathematical paradigm - examples are hypothesis testing and the use of alphabetically optimal designs. Such one-shot procedures, where the model is assumed known a priori and fixed, are appropriate for some practical problems and are attractive because they allow rigorous development of theories of statistics based on mathematics alone. By contrast, discovery of new knowledge requires the use of the scientific paradigm in which the model is continually changing. Scientific method is thus mathematically incoherent. The importance of robustness is discussed both for analysis and design, and the relationship between these two kinds of robustness is clarified. Implications for teaching are discussed.},

	abstract = {Thermochemical conversion of oil sludge (OS) residues from crude oil refinery was studied as an alternative for treatment and energy recovery before OS final disposal. A simulation model for OS gasification was developed and validated by using AspenPlus™ V 11.0. Three scenarios by considering different gasifying agents were evaluated, aiming the assessment of different gasification parameters and performance indexes such as gasification temperature, cold-gas efficiency, syngas yield, and LHV. To evaluate the potential use of syngas to generate electricity, three different prime movers such as steam Rankine cycle, gas microturbine, and gas-Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) were modeled. A hydrogen-rich syngas from OS gasification with air/steam mixture was reached (38.2 vol.\%) at ER 0.20. Syngas LHV and syngas yield ranged between 8.6-3.0 MJ/Nm3 and 0.6-1.3 Nm3/kg OS, when ER was increased from 0.25 to 0.45, respectively. The highest energy recovery potential (electricity generation) was obtained when using syngas to power a gas-ICE, with a generation index of about 0.47 kWh/kg-OS at ER ratio of 0.25. Therefore, OS thermochemical conversion into syngas and its subsequent use to generate electricity could be a technological alternative to oily residues management inside an oil refinery that could efficiently transform a dangerous residue into electricity.},

	abstract = {The low efficiency of renewable electricity storage has been considered as a bottleneck of the scalable and low-carbon Power-to-Gas energy transformation concept. This paper investigates the combination of CO2 biofixation using Spirulina platensis microalgae and catalytic hydrothermal gasification of wet organic feedstock for the storage of fluctuating electricity and direct utilisation of waste CO2. The presented method enables wet microalgae biomass conversion into H2 and C1-C2 rich fuel gas stream using hydrothermal conversion that is valorised further to methane. For bridging the gap between theoretical investigations and the application of this approach, experiments were carried out at elevated temperatures (632.9-717.0 °C) based on a central composite design of the experiment. Biogas upgrading was evaluated by ASPEN Plus flowsheeting software. The results show that the proposed storage cycle outperforms the state-of-the-art biological and chemical-based Sabatier methanations with an overall round-trip efficiency of 42.3\%. The optimised thermo-chemical process enables to achieve simultaneously high H2 (9.05 mol kg−1) and CH4 (7.91 mol kg−1) yields with an enhanced 71.23\% carbon conversion ratio. Moreover, the environmental and cost evaluations of the currently proposed bio-synthetic process indicate low associated CO2 equivalent emission (99.4 ± 12.6 g CO2,eq kWh−1) with 144.9 €MWh-1 normalised total annual natural gas production cost. Ideally the proposed storage cycle requires less H2 from external sources, effective CO2 utilisation becomes available through the biofixation and hydrothermal conversion of the wet organic feedstock and closed carbon emission cycle can be accomplished.},

	abstract = {Conventional thermochemical treatment of sewage sludge (SS) is energy-intensive due to its high moisture content. To overcome this drawback, the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process was used to convert SS into clean solid fuel without prior drying. Different carbonization times were applied in order to produce hydrochars possessing better fuel properties. After the carbonization process, fuel characteristics and combustion behaviors of hydrochars were evaluated. Elemental analysis showed that 88\% of carbon was recovered while 60\% of nitrogen and sulfur was removed. Due to dehydration and decarboxylation reactions, hydrogen/carbon and oxygen/carbon atomic ratios reduced to 1.53 and 0.39, respectively. It was found that the fuel ratio increased to 0.18 by prolonging the carbonization process. Besides, longer carbonization time seemed to decrease oxygen containing functional groups while carbon aromaticity structure increased, thereby rendering hydrochars highly hydrophobic. The thermogravimetric analysis showed that the combustion decomposition was altered from a single stage for raw sludge to two stages for hydrochars. The combustion reaction was best fitted to the first order for both raw sludge and hydrochars. The combustion of hydrochars is expected to be easier and more stable than raw sludge because of lower activation energy and pre-exponential factor. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Hydrochar derived at 320°C and 12.0 MPa (SHC-320) was screened for systematic cocombustion with different-rank coals. The results suggest that SHC-320 reduced the activation energy of the blends and altered the main combustion profiles. Meanwhile, blending of SHC-320 induced greater heat loss for higher-rank coals, whereas a higher portion of SHC-320 further improved the ignition reactivity of high-rank coal blends. In the high-temperature region, the value of the pre-exponential factor increased with increasing coal/SHC-320 ratio, resulting in more intense synergistic effects in blends. At a low coal/SHC-320 ratio (30:70), intense antisynergistic effects occurred in cocombustion with low- or high-rank coals. As a result of distinct synergistic interactions, cocombustion with moderate-rank coal achieved the best combustion efficiency among the blends. These findings benefit efficient utilization of DSS as a hydrochar solid fuel in existing cofiring power plants.},

Nickel promoted Pt catalyst with optimized Ni:Pt molar ratio afforded highest glycerol conversion rate (81.21\%) and carbon conversion to gas (15.3\%) although hydrogen gasification ratio (7.2\%) was poorer than that of noble metals promoted Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Adding CaO significantly enhanced the fraction and selectivity of H2 over Pt-Ni catalyst and those of CH4 were reduced to a negligible level, which was possibly attributed to the facilitated water-gas shift reaction and inhibited methanation through in-situ CO2 sorption via carbonation. Results suggested that Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts improved dehydrogenation-decarboxylation and dehydration-hydrogenation reactions, leading to high glycerol conversions. Introducing CaO further favored C-C bond cleavage towards high H2 yield. The catalytic performance can be completely recovered after regenerating the catalyst and adding sacrificial CaO. In terms of reduced consumption of precious metal catalyst, excellent catalyst performance and hydrothermal stability, combination of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst and CaO additive was identified as an effective catalytic system for H2 production in CAPR of glycerol. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Although energy recovery rate decreased with increasing temperature and pressure, significant decarboxylation and dehydration reactions led to hydrochars with best fuel quality at 320 °C. High moisture content favored decarboxylation reaction but reduced H2 and CH4 yields. Compared to that in the absence of additive, H2 yield increased almost 6-fold at 380 °C and Ca/C molar ratio of 0.2, resulting in 58\% H2 and 26\% CH4 in final fuel gas. The results suggested that mineralization of heteroatomic compounds and dissolution of metals or mineral elements occurred during HTC. Under higher temperature and pressure, heavy metals or mineral elements were prone to be immobilized whereas dehalogenation became more distinct.

	abstract = {In order to reduce considerable emissions of N-containing pollutants from combustion of sewage sludge derived solid fuel, an integrated system of hydrothermal deamination and air stripping was developed to effectively remove and recover nitrogen from dewatered sewage sludge (DSS). Three characteristic hydrothermal regimes contributing to deamination were identified. Initial hydrolysis of inorganic-N and labile protein-N was responsible for ammonium (NH 4 +-N) released below 300 °C/9.3 MPa, whereas deamination of pyridine-N dominated when being raised to 340 °C/15.5 MPa. At 380 °C and 22.0 MPa, remarkable deamination of stable protein-N occurred, which was accompanied by formation of more heterocyclic-N compounds and resulted in 76.9\% N removal from DSS and 7980 mg/L NH 4 +-N solution. As a result of catalytic hydrolysis and cracking, calcium oxide additive not only accelerated deamination of stable protein-N, pyrrole-N, and pyridine-N, but also favored transformations of protein-N and quaternary-N to nitrile-N and pyridine-N, respectively, leading to 86.4\% total N removal efficiency. The nitrogen transformation reactions and conversion pathways during hydrothermal deamination were proposed and elaborated in detail. Moreover, an efficient air stripping process was coupled to remove and recover ammonia from liquid fraction via ammonium sulfate. Consequently, this system achieved an overall N recovery rate of 62\%.},

Experiments were carried out in a batch reactor with glucose and also in the presence of the alkali from 200 °C, 2 MPa to 450 °C, 34 MPa at constant water loading. Without sodium hydroxide, glucose decomposed to produce mainly carbon dioxide, water, char and tar. Furfural, its derivatives and reaction products dominated the ethyl acetate extract of the water (organic fraction) at lower reaction conditions. This indicated that the dehydration of glucose to yield these products was unfavourable to hydrogen gas production. In the presence of sodium hydroxide however, glucose initially decomposed to form mostly alkylated and hydroxylated carbonyl compounds, whose further decomposition yielded hydrogen gas. It was observed that at 350 °C, 21.5 MPa, half of the optimum hydrogen gas yield had formed and at 450 °C, 34 MPa, more than 80 volume percent of the gaseous effluent was hydrogen gas, while the balance was hydrocarbon gases, mostly methane (≥10 volume percent).

The negative impact of power generation systems will surely increase due to the continuous rise in energy demand. As a result, alternative methods must be found to reduce stationary and transport engines energy consumption and pollutant emissions, and the use of syngas as a fuel could be a very promising solution. This review is an attempt to aim and promote a wider employment of syngas as a fuel for internal combustion engines. Hence, after an overview of the technologies for syngas production, a detailed analysis of different applications of this gaseous fuel is presented and discussed. Specifically, dual-fuel Compression Ignition engines, Homogeneous Charge Spark Ignition engines and Direct Injection Spark Ignition engines have been investigated under syngas operating conditions from both experimental and numerical points of views. The performance and the emissions of such engines are carefully analysed and discussed. Indeed, they are very sensitive to the physical and chemical properties of syngas, i.e. the amount of CO and H2, the laminar flame speed, the wide range of flammability and the lower density of syngas compared to air density.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC)/liquefaction (HTL)/gasification (HTG) are promising processes for biofuel production from biomass containing high moisture. However, wastewater, the aqueous phase (AP) byproduct from these hydrothermal processes, is inevitably produced in large amounts. The AP contains {\textgreater}20\% of the biomass carbon, and the total organic carbon in AP is as high as 10–20 g/L. The treatment and utilization of AP are becoming a bottleneck for the industrialization of hydrothermal technologies. The major challenges are the presence of various inhibitory substances and the high complexity of AP. Bioenergy recovery from AP has attracted increasing interest. In the present review, the compositions and characteristics of AP are first presented. Then, the progress in recovering bioenergy from AP by recirculation as the reaction solvent, anaerobic digestion (AD), supercritical water gasification (SCWG), microbial fuel cell (MFC), microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), and microalgae cultivation is discussed. Recirculation of AP as reaction solvent is preferable for AP from biomass with relatively low moisture; AD, MFC/MEC, and microalgae cultivation are desirable for the treatment of AP produced from processing biomass with low lignin content at relatively low temperatures; SCWG is widely applicable but is energy-intensive. Finally, challenges and corresponding strategies are proposed to promote the development of AP valorization technologies. Comprehensive analysis of AP compositions, clarification of the mechanisms of valorization processes, valorization process integration detoxification of AP, polycultures and co-processing of AP with other waste, enhancement in pollutant removal, scaling-up performance, and the techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of valorization systems are promising directions in future investigations.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants in Germany is currently disposed of via thermal treatment and agricultural utilization or used for landscaping. Increasing focus on hygiene, soil protection and most recently on phosphorus recovery combined with the associated legal changes leads to an increased relevance of thermal sewage sludge treatment processes. This article reviews existing technologies for thermal treatment of sewage sludge with a view to the situation in Germany. Thermal sewage sludge treatment can be divided into different processes: drying reduces high water contents of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge and often precedes subsequent treatment processes. Today, most of the sewage sludge in Germany is incinerated, about half in mono-incineration, mostly in stationary fluidized beds, and the other half in co-incineration, in particular in coal-fired power plants, cement kilns or, to a lesser extent, waste incineration plants. Some alternative thermal processes, mainly pyrolysis and gasification, but also metallurgical approaches, are tested in bench or pilot scale. Recent amendments to the German Sewage Sludge Ordinance will restrict the disposal route of co-incineration in future. Consequently, a significant increase in mono-incineration capacity is expected. These processes should enable the combination of environmentally friendly disposal and phosphorus recovery.},

	abstract = {Lignocellulosic feedstocks such as forestry biomass and agricultural crop residues can be utilized to generate biofuels and biochemicals. In addition, a large amount of non-plant residues or biogenic wastes is also generated worldwide that has huge potentials but remains underutilized. Converting these organic waste materials through thermochemical and biochemical processes into biofuels is widely regarded as a remedial approach to address waste management and clean energy problems. One of such thermochemical biomass-to-gas technologies is hydrothermal gasification in the presence of subcritical or supercritical water, which utilizes the unique fluid properties of water to disintegrate effectively the organic wastes into hydrogen-rich syngas. This paper reviews the thermophysical chemistry of subcritical and supercritical water as well as their role in generating syngas from the hydrothermal decomposition of biogenic, polymeric and organic wastes such as municipal solid waste, animal manure, food waste, industrial effluents, sewage sludge, mixed plastics, waste tires and petrochemical wastes. The paper also describes different technologies used for syngas cleaning and conditioning together with gas-to-liquid technology such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce hydrocarbon fuels. The current progress, challenges and knowledge gaps in the research and development of hydrothermal gasification of biogenic wastes are also discussed.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, conversion of bio-renewable resources to biofuels or bio-based chemicals has received a great deal of attention, owing to the resource exhaustion, environmental concerns, and socio-economic issues of fossil fuels. One of the promising biomass conversion routes is the supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass for producing H2 or combustible gases. SCWG is an effective conversion technology, particularly for high water-containing feedstocks, because of its unique advantage by avoiding the costly feedstock de-watering/drying process. To improve gasification performance, it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the basic chemistry and kinetics of biomass SCWG. Therefore, this review focuses on the performance (chemistry and kinetics) of SCWG of biomass model compounds (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, lipid, and protein), and more importantly the binary or multi-component systems to elucidate the interaction effects induced by two or more biomass components in supercritical water (SCW). In addition, the advantages and technical challenges for using SCW as the reaction medium are discussed. Finally, the future R\&D directions are presented.},

	abstract = {Biomass waste generation is increasing enormously and biomass burning emits greenhouse gas emissions causing severe effects on the environment and health of the population. It contains high organic and carbon content which can be reused/diverted for useful products (like Biochar) that facilitate climate change mitigation. Biochar, a renewable carbon, is gaining importance and it opens up an area of research to explore on the properties and stability of biochar, its wide applications, impacts on soil characteristics, techno-economic details, carbon and nitrogen interactions of biochar-soil matrix, and emission control. This review addresses opportunities of biomass wastes for biochar production, various thermo-chemical reactions for preparation and its basics/mechanisms, properties of biochar and hydrochar, and gaps/operational challenges, and summarizes wide applications of biochar in soil improvement, climate change mitigation, energy production, waste management, and environmental remediation. The effect of physico-chemical parameters (temperature, heating rate, chemical composition, etc.) on the biochar production will help in valorizing this industry. The optimized process conditions involved in low temperature (torrefaction, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization), pyrolysis (Fast, Slow, Flash), gasification, and combustion processes for biochar, syngas, and bio-oil production are to be explored. The critical review on the biochar addition influence on CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in various soil types and carbon sequestration is done here. The modification and activation of biochar are recently attractive due to their role in improving biochar quality and for expanding its applications. Limitations and future status of biochar production from biomass waste are highlighted. Biochar will be a promising solution as an alternative to fossil fuels, waste management, bioenergy, and combat climate change.},

This survey highlights the current approaches, relevant methods, technologies and resources adopted for high yield hydrogen production. Prominent thermochemical methods i.e. pyrolysis, gasification, supercritical water gasification, hydrothermal upgrading followed by steam gasification, bio-oil reforming, and pyrolysis inline reforming have been discussed thoroughly in view of the current research trend and latest emerging technologies. Influences of important factors and parameters on hydrogen yield, such as biomass type, temperature, steam to biomass ratio, retention time, biomass particle size, heating rate, etc. have also been extensively studied. Catalyst is a vital integrant that has received enough attention due to its encouraging influence on hydrogen production. Literature confirms that hydrogen obtained from biomass has high-energy efficiency and potential to reduce greenhouse gases hence, it deserves versatile applications in the coming future. The study also reveals that hydrogen production through steam reforming, pyrolysis, and in-line reforming deliver a considerable amount of hydrogen from biomass with higher process efficiency. It has been identified that higher temperature, suitable steam to biomass ratio and catalyst type favor useful hydrogen yield. Nevertheless, hydrogen is not readily available in the sufficient amount and production cost is still high. Tar generation during thermochemical processing of biomass is also a concern and requires consistent efforts to minimize it.},

	abstract = {In this study 315 peer-reviewed studies on environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies were critically analysed. The technologies considered were anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis, gasification and incineration. It was found that overall increasingly more studies are concerned with LCA on waste-treatment systems. Although incineration and anaerobic digestion were primarily assessed, especially in recent years, a growing number of LCA-studies investigated advanced thermal treatment options. The geographical scope within the studies under review focused mainly on European (195 studies) and Asian (68 studies) regions. In regards to their quality, a majority of the analysed studies were marked by several shortcomings and showed poor compliance with the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. 55 studies did not present a functional unit and {\textgreater}45\% of all reviewed studies did not present a life cycle inventory. More than 50\% of the reviewed studies omitted a sensitivity analysis and a comprehensive assessment of all impact categories was not present in most studies. By selecting studies that analysed two or more different WtE treatment options, the global warming potential and the acidification potential of the considered five different technologies were compared. By contrasting advanced treatment options against incineration, substantial environmental benefits of advanced treatment options could not be observed. However, only 34 studies fulfilled the criteria to be taken into account for this comparison. The main finding within this scope, was that anaerobic digestion and gasification seemed to outcompete incineration in the conversion process of waste. Cascaded waste treatment, i.e. combining several treatment technologies, was only present in few studies. Environmental benefits could be assigned to these treatment paths in most cases. Lastly, techno-economic aspects are highlighted and appropriate policies are deducted from the obtained results.},

Hydrothermal processes (HTP) seem to be promising for treating such biomass as they best work with substrates with 70\% to 90\% water content. However, thus far the suitability of HTP for this purpose has not been sufficiently evaluated, for which this work aims to identify suitable multi-criteria analysis (MCA) methods that can be used to identify promising ways for the hydrothermal treatment of wet bio-waste. A review on 31 recent MCA studies in bio-waste management was conducted with the aim of comparing them to methodological requirements for evaluating HTP. Furthermore, an MCA approach for HTP based on the review findings is proposed. Results show that no observed MCA method is directly transferable for assessing HTP, for which a customized approach combining the analytical hierarchy process and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions is proposed and preliminarily validated with literature data. These preliminary calculations indicate that hydrothermal gasification seems most promising under consideration of multiple criteria using the available average and exemplary data. However, needless to say there is still a long way to go to obtain the sufficient adequate data to validate and use the model appropriately, for which further studies are necessary to acquire more reliable data and to assess also future technology developments of HTP.},

In order to obtain a holistic understanding of WT processing system, this review has comprehensively discussed recent advances in WT of biomass to produce high quality solid fuel and its subsequent thermochemical applications. This review has not only summarized distinct advantages of WT over dry torrefaction of biomass with high moisture content but also clarified the similarities and differences between WT and hydrothermal carbonization. According to structures and chemical compositions of components therein, four representative categories of diverse biomass materials were selected to describe the influence of intrinsic nature of biomass on fuel quality of hydrochar derived from WT. Furthermore, this article has attempted to figure out the inherent relationship between WT conditions and fuel properties with respect to operating conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, and residence time), biomass to water ratio, acids and additives, torrefaction atmosphere, and heating techniques. Three conventional thermochemical applications of wet-torrefied biomass have been extensively reviewed to reveal that WT could benefit energy recovery from wet biomass in terms of improved quality of ultimate energy carriers and obviously reduced pollutants emissions. Nevertheless, critical concerns associated with optimization of operating cost, minimization and controlling of pollutants emissions, re-design of industrially applicable reactor, and system integration with downstream applications have been pointed out in order to make WT technology more environmentally and commercially viable.},

Chemical and chemical engineering studies are introduced and sorted into categories, which are the main factors influencing the chemical reaction pathways of SCWG. These are: the components of biomass (carbohydrates, lignin, ash, proteins and lipids), reaction conditions e.g. concentration and the possible addition of heterogeneous catalysts. Most studies focus on model compounds, here the interference of the components in mixtures give a deeper understanding in view of the conversion of real biomass. Also studies with biomass are reported; here in most cases the effect of salts, catalyzing hydrogen formation, is dominating. The progress in knowledge is evaluated in view of the hurdles to overcome for a wide industrial application. Recent paper hints to a future of hydrothermal gasification as part of a bio-refinery and with an internal use of hydrogen produced.},

	abstract = {With increasing construction of wastewater treatment plants and stricter policies, municipal sewage sludge (MSS) disposal has become a serious problem. Treatment of MSS in supercritical water (SCW) can avoid the pre-drying procedure and secondary pollution of conventional methods. SCW treatment methods can be divided into supercritical water gasification (SCWG), supercritical water partial oxidation (SCWPO) and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) technologies with increasing amounts of oxidants. Hydrogen-rich gases can be generated from MSS by SCWG or SCWPO technology using oxidants less than stoichiometric ratio while organic compounds can be completely degraded by SCWO technology with using an oxidant excess. For SCWG and SCWPO technologies, this paper reviews the influences of different process variables (MSS properties, moisture content, temperature, oxidant amount and catalysts) on the production of gases. For SCWO technology, this paper reviews research regarding the removal of organics with or without hydrothermal flames and the changes in heavy metal speciation and risk. Finally, typical systems for handling MSS are summarized and research needs and challenges are proposed.},

	abstract = {Municipal sewage sludge produced from wastewater treatment plants generally contains 0.25-12\% solid materials and around 70-80\% organic matter content. Sewage sludge treatment and disposal is the most complicated and expensive step of wastewater treatment, because of the dewatering requirement, costly operations and processes, space requirement, and environmental standards getting more stringent day by day. Gasification of municipal sewage sludge by supercritical water technology is a promising and developing method to concurrently succeed energy recovery and sludge treatment. The objective of this study is to give information about supercritical water gasification and its applicability for hydrogen rich gas production from municipal sewage sludge. Based on the literature data, supercritical water gasification used for hydrogen and methane production from sewage sludge is a new, clean and encouraging technology and it is feasible according to technical and economical evaluations. Two-stage hydrothermal gasification systems and catalytic process concepts achieving optimum hydrogen production at lower temperatures and pressures can be achieved by i) pre-treatment such as steam explosion, electroporation and liquefying, ii) decreasing the particle size by grinder, iii) the selection of an appropriate reactor configuration and appropriate material selection to overcome the corrosion and plugging problems for future applications.},

	abstract = {Gasification has emerged as a prominent technique to convert biomass, coal, plastic, and municipals wastes sludge (generated from agriculture, industrial, and domestics, urban centers) into energy in the form of gaseous products. However, co-gasification of these materials has many advantages, such as desired product yield and uninterrupted feedstock supply as well as the sustainable utilization and disposal of these wastes. Numerous reviews have been documented based on the gasification of individual materials of biomass and coal, nevertheless, very few reviews have been reported on the process of co-gasification. In co-gasification, the effect of parameters becomes very important when dealing with the co-gasification of different mixed materials. The objective of this review to study the effect of temperature, blending ratio, and equivalence ratio (ER) on catalytic co-gasification of biomass-coal, biomass-plastic, biomass-sewage sludge, and mixed plastic blends. In addition, the effects of these parameters on gaseous products, heating values, tar formation, and gasification performance have been analyzed. It is also important to specify the ranges of parameters for the feed combinations in catalytic co-gasification that will provide a guideline for researchers and commercial enterprises to investigate co-gasification. For temperature from 650 to 750 °C found good for hydrogen rich syngas production. Whereas, the ratio of biomass 50\% or above and ER of 0.20 and 0.25 were found good for higher hydrogen and lower CO2 and tar production. Moreover, the current issues are related to technology, operational problems, policy requirements and route map for commercial success of co-gasification technology have been highlighted.},

	abstract = {The increasing levels of sewage sludge production demands research and development to introduce more commercially feasible options for reducing socio-economic and environmental problems associated with its current treatment. Sewage sludge may be processed to produce useful products or as a feedstock for energy generation. Initially, the characteristics of sewage sludge are discussed in terms of composition and the current options for its treatment with the associated environmental impacts. Processes to valorize sewage sludge are discussed, including heavy metal removal from sewage sludge, production of bio-char, production and use of activated carbon and use of sewage sludge combustion ash in cement and concrete. Thermochemical processes i.e., pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, also gasification and combustion for process intensification, energy and resource recovery from sewage sludge are then critically reviewed in detail. The pyrolysis of sewage sludge to produce a bio-oil is covered in relation to product bio-oil composition, reactor type and the use of catalysts. Gasification of sewage sludge focusses on the characteristics of the different available reactor types and the influence of a range of process parameters and catalysts on gas yield and composition. The selection and design of catalysts are of vital importance to enhance the selectivity of the selected thermochemical pyrolysis or gasification process. The catalysts used for sewage sludge treatment need more research to enable selectivity towards the targeted desired end-products along with optimization of parametric conditions and development of innovative reactor technologies. The combustion of sewage sludge is reviewed in terms of reactor technologies, flue gas cleaning systems and pollutant emissions. In addition, reactor technologies in terms of technological strength and market competitiveness with the particular application to sewage sludge are compared for the first time for thermochemical conversion. A critical comparison is made of the drying techniques, co-feedstocks and catalytic processes, reaction kinetics, reactor technologies, operating conditions to be optimized, removal of impurities, fuel properties, their constraints and required improvements. The emphasis of this review is to promote environmental sustainability for process intensification, energy and resource recovery from pyrolysis, gasification and combustion involving the use of catalysts.},

	abstract = {Gasification is a well proven thermal conversion technology that has been used to convert solid fuel into gaseous fuel. There are different types of conventional feedstocks such as coal and biomass that have been gasified in either individual or blended form. The advantage of co-gasification over typical gasification is the ability to obtain the desired product gas composition by varying the blending ratio and feedstock. Furthermore, it is applicable for many feedstocks such as sewage sludge, black liquor, glycerol, and municipal solid waste. These feedstocks have good thermophysical properties, however, gasification of these feedstocks is difficult using a conventional technique, thus highlighting the need for co-gasification. Recently, the effect of feedstock type and their blending for syngas production have attracted interest among researchers especially when feedstocks are non-conventional. Several review articles have been published on gasification of individual coal and biomass. However, no review that exhaustively dealt with the catalytic co-gasification of a different kind of conventional and non-conventional feedstock. The feedstock type and blending ratio of feedstock are the most important parameters that affect the co-gasification process. The objective of the current paper is therefore to review the effect of feedstock type and their blending ratio on syngas quality, co-gasification performance, and tar formation for catalytic co-gasification of both conventional and non-conventional feedstocks. This review highlights the need for research and development in co-gasification and also provides the research gap for further research to develop a state of art technologies.},

	abstract = {Co-gasification of coal and biomass is emerging as potential clean fuel technology to achieve high thermodynamic efficiency with relatively low CO 2 emission. The coal and biomass have been exclusively gasified more than a century to obtain gas–liquid fuels and the production of chemicals. Co-gasification has higher efficiency than the solitary coal gasification because the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content of biomass help to ignite and enhance the rate of gasification. It is suggested that the extensive research on carbon reactivity pattern, heat release, reaction kinetics, etc. may support to reduce the uncertainties in the co-gasification performance of coal and biomass blends, particularly in India. The prospects of co-gasification technology in Indian context have been discussed considering the abundance of varieties of coal and biomass. The suitability of existing gasifier procedures and their limitations with operating parameters like temperature, residence time, density optimisation, feed rate, agglomeration intensity, the tar formation and techno-economics involved are described. Also, this paper reviews the research highlights of the history of co-gasification and the advancement in upcoming challenges like a design of gasifier, access and preparation of biomass, disposal of residue, environmental concerns and reassurance to the operators for execution of large and small-scale projects.},

Co-gasification has unveiled its potential amongst thermal techniques, as a result of the valuable products obtained, strengthening a solid position in the conversion of residues. Thus, the prevention of a complete depletion of non-renewable sources is supported and the effects of their utilization alleviated. Extensive literature review was conducted and, few reports on co-gasification of biomass and wastes were found. In this context, this review addresses their thermal conversion, highlighting issues related to the equipment, operating conditions and physicochemical phenomena involved in such a complex process. Among other conclusions, the most important finding of this work was the synergy often encountered between the two feedstocks, proving co-gasification can overcome several of the individual gasification issues enhancing products quality and yields over biomass or wastes alone, and attesting its environmental-friendly character, with lower greenhouse gas emissions. It was also possible to depict some trends on the effect of biomass and waste blending ratios, as well as elucidating some of the mechanisms involved in their interaction. These are majorly explained by the response of molecules during pyrolysis and by hydrogen transfer from waste polymers to biomass derivatives. Experimental conditions were also assessed, fluidized beds being reported as the most suitable reactors for biomass and wastes, under several different possible combinations of operational parameters. A critical discussion is presented, aiming to contribute to a more profound understanding of this matter, its key points and noteworthy potential.},

Furthermore, co-gasification of biomass and coal as an efficient method to protect the environment by reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been comparatively discussed. In fact, the increasing attention to renewable resources is driven by the climate change due to GHG emissions caused by the widespread utilization of conventional fossil fuels, while biomass gasification is considered as a potentially sustainable and environmentally-friendly technology. Nevertheless, social and environmental aspects should also be taken into account when designing such facilities, to guarantee the sustainable use of biomass.

Most notable topics reviewed are slagging and fouling caused by the relatively reactive alkali and alkaline earth compounds (K2O, Na2O and CaO) found in biomass ash. The alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEM) present and dispersed in biomass fuels induce catalytic activity during co-conversion with coal. The catalytic activity is most noticeable when blended with high rank coals. The synergy during co-conversion is still controversial although it has been theorized that biomass acts like a hydrogen donor in liquefaction. Published literature also shows that coal and biomass exhibit different mechanisms, depending on the operating conditions, for the formation of nitrogen (N) and sulfur species. Utilization aspects of fly ash from blending coal and biomass are discussed. Recommendations are made on pretreatment options to increase the energy density of biomass fuels through pelletization, torrefaction and flash pyrolysis to reduce transportation costs. © 2014 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the characteristics of 26 varieties of biomass produced from forestry, agriculture, municipality, and industry in Taiwan to test their applicability in thermal conversion technologies and evaluation of enhanced energy efficiency. Understanding the reactivity of the tested biomass, the cluster analysis was also used in this research to classify into characteristics groups of biomass. This research also evaluated the feasibility of energy application of tested biomass by comparing it to the physicochemical properties of various coals used in Taiwan's power plants. The experimental results indicated that the volatile matter content of the all tested biomass was 60\% and above. It can be concluded that the higher carbon conversion rate will occur in the thermal conversion process of all tested biomass. Based on the results of lower heating value (LHV) of MSW and non-hazardous industrial sludge, the LHV was lower than other tested biomass that was between 1000 and 1800. kcal/kg. This is due to the higher moisture content of MSW and sludge that resulted in the lower LHV. Besides, the LHV of other tested biomass and their derived fuels was similar to the tested coal. However, the energy densities of woody and agricultural waste were smaller than that of the coal because the bulky densities of woody and agricultural wastes were low. That is, the energy utilization efficiency of woody and agricultural waste was relatively low. To improve the energy density of tested biomass, appropriate pre-treatment technologies, such as shredding, pelletizing or torrefied technologies can be applied, that will enhance the energy utilization efficiency of all tested biomass. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Gasification experiments were performed for several feedstocks alone (wastewater sludge, waste wood, reeds, olive pomace, solid recovered fuel, paper labels and plastic labels) using a fixed bed reactor operating in semi-batch conditions. In order to combine them in an optimal gasifying blend, the gasification behavior of each feedstock was compared with that of wastewater sludge through the following criteria: the raw feedstock proximate and ultimate composition, the solid conversion, the gas heating value, the pollutants release and the ashes melting. Operated alone, the conversion rate of the feedstocks after 58 min of solid residence time was over 77\% of initial mass. The Syngas low heating value produced at 1123 K was in the range of 9.0 to 11.9 MJ m−3. The major concerns regarding the wastewater sludge were the pollutants precursors' release (NH3, COS…) and the ash slagging and fouling. The calculated slagging and fouling indexes were high also for olive pomace and for waste wood. Finally, among the possible blends studied the paper labels and plastic labels can be co-gasified with secondary and digested wastewater sludge without any restriction, reeds and solid recovered fuel can be blinded with secondary wastewater sludge without any restriction, a specific attention have to be taken to fouling when they are blended with digested wastewater sludge. The blend based on waste wood and olives pomace should be avoided for instance due to their ash slagging and fouling tendency.},

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [(RdRp), also named nsp12] is the central component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery, and it appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug remdesivir. We report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of COVID-19 virus full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at 2.9-angstrom resolution. In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified β-hairpin domain at its N terminus. A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase. The structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics that target viral RdRp.},

	abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans. However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species. We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these viruses, to construct reproducible animal models, and ultimately develop countermeasures to conquer not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also these emerging coronaviral diseases.},

	abstract = {Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats 1–4 . Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans 5–7 . Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6\% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96\% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of . In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.},

This innovative data source can improve the precision of epidemiological modeling to understand the penetrance of SARS-CoV-2 in specific vulnerable communities. Here, we tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts and detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the N gene at significant titers (57 to 303 copies per ml of sewage) in the period from 18 to 25 March 2020 using RT-qPCR. We validated detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Sanger sequencing the PCR product from the S gene. Viral titers observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinically confirmed cases in Massachusetts as of 25 March. Our approach is scalable and may be useful in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks.},

In order to provide insights into the epidemiology of SAFV in Italy, 141 raw sewage samples collected throughout Italy were tested using broad-range nested RT-PCR primers targeting the 5′-NC region. Seven samples (5·0\%) were confirmed as SAFV in samples collected in North, Centre and Southern Italy. Typing was attempted through amplification of the VP1 coding region, using both published and newly designed primers, and one sample was characterized as SAFV-2. Significance and Impact of the Study: Prevalence, genetic diversity and geographic distribution of SAFV in Italy is currently unknown. This study represents the first detection of SAFV in sewage samples in Italy, suggesting that it is circulating in the population despite lack of clinical reporting. Whether the virus is associated with asymptomatic cases or with undetected gastroenteritis or respiratory illness is unknown. Further studies are needed to investigate on the occurrence and persistence of SAFV in water environments and its waterborne transmission potential.},

	abstract = {Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has become an attractive tool for combating the spread of COVID-19 by assessing the presence or levels of the virus shed in a population. However, the methods to quantify viral RNA and to link those quantities to the level of infection within the community vary. In this study, we sought to identify and optimize scalable methods for recovery of viral nucleic acids from wastewater and attempted to use a constitutive member of the gut virome, human-specific crAssphage, to help account for unknown levels of SARS-CoV-2 decay and dilution in the wastewater infrastructure. Results suggest that ultracentrifugation of a small volume of wastewater through a 50\% sucrose cushion followed by total nucleic acid extraction yielded quantifiable virus in an area with a modest number of COVID-19 cases. Further, the ratio of log10(SARS-CoV-2):log10(crAssphage) appears to be associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the Syracuse, NY area. In areas where ultracentrifuges are available, these methods may be used to link SARS-CoV-2 quantities in wastewater to levels of transmission within communities with sewer service.},

	abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool to understand the actual incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, can be shed in the feces of infected individuals regardless of their symptoms. The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200–5000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 × 103 copies/L by N\_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, with sequence confirmation of the qPCR product, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 × 103–8.2 × 104 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 × 102–2.5 × 103 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked in the community. This is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Japan.},

	abstract = {The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater samples has been documented in several countries. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is potentially effective for early warning of a COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was investigated and was compared with the number of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the study area during COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. In total, 45 influent wastewater samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from 0.3 and 0 to {\textgreater}20 per 100,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the samples was detected using several PCR-based assays. Of the 45 samples, 21 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to at least one of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. The detection frequency increased when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 people exceeded 10 in each prefecture; however, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected at a low frequency even when the number was below 1.0. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater could be detected in the early stage of the epidemic, even if the number of confirmed cases potentially underestimates the actual numbers of cases. This suggests that WBE approach can potentially act as an early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan.},

Therefore, viruses causing gastroenteritis may be detected in wastewater, even if only a few persons are infected. In this study, the presence of eight pathogenic viruses (norovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, Aichi virus, parechovirus, hepatitis A virus [HAV], and hepatitis E virus) was investigated in sewage to explore whether their identification could be used as an early warning of outbreaks. Samples of the untreated sewage were collected in proportion to flow at Ryaverket, Gothenburg, Sweden. Daily samples collected during every second week between January and May 2013 were pooled and analyzed for detection of viruses by concentration through adsorption to milk proteins and PCR. The largest amount of noroviruses was detected in sewage 2 to 3 weeks before most patients were diagnosed with this infection in Gothenburg. The other viruses were detected at lower levels. HAV was detected between weeks 5 and 13, and partial sequencing of the structural VP1protein identified three different strains. Two strains were involved in an ongoing outbreak in Scandinavia and were also identified in samples from patients with acute hepatitis A in Gothenburg during spring of 2013. The third strain was unique and was not detected in any patient sample. The method used may thus be a tool to detect incipient outbreaks of these viruses and provide early warning before the causative pathogens have been recognized in health care.},

Sampling was carried out on 8 and 27 May 2020 at the Old Pirana Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) at Ahmedabad, Gujarat that receives effluent from Civil Hospital treating COVID-19 patients. All three, i.e. ORF1ab, N and S genes of SARS-CoV-2, were found in the influent with no genes detected in effluent collected on 8 and 27 May 2020. Increase in SARS-CoV-2 genetic loading in the wastewater between 8 and 27 May 2020 samples concurred with corresponding increase in the number of active COVID-19 patients in the city. The number of gene copies was comparable to that reported in untreated wastewaters of Australia, China and Turkey and lower than that of the USA, France and Spain. However, temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations need to be substantiated further from the perspectives of daily and short-term changes of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater through long-term monitoring. The study results SARS-CoV-2 will assist concerned authorities and policymakers to formulate and/or upgrade COVID-19 surveillance to have a more explicit picture of the pandemic curve. While infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through the excreted viral genetic material in the aquatic environment is still being debated, the presence and detection of genes in wastewater systems makes a strong case for the environmental surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

The first autochthonous Italian case of COVID-19 was documented on February 21, 2020. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Italy earlier than that date, by analysing 40 composite influent wastewater samples collected - in the framework of other wastewater-based epidemiology projects - between October 2019 and February 2020 from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in three cities and regions in northern Italy (Milan/Lombardy, Turin/Piedmont and Bologna/Emilia Romagna). Twenty-four additional samples collected in the same WWTPs between September 2018 and June 2019 (i.e. long before the onset of the epidemic) were included as ‘blank’ samples. Viral concentration was performed according to the standard World Health Organization procedure for poliovirus sewage surveillance, with modifications. Molecular analysis was undertaken with both nested RT-PCR and real-rime RT-PCR assays. A total of 15 positive samples were confirmed by both methods. The earliest dates back to 18 December 2019 in Milan and Turin and 29 January 2020 in Bologna. Virus concentration in the samples ranged from below the limit of detection (LOD) to 5.6 × 104 genome copies (g.c.)/L, and most of the samples (23 out of 26) were below the limit of quantification of PCR. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in northern Italy at the end of 2019. Moreover, it was circulating in different geographic regions simultaneously, which changes our previous understanding of the geographical circulation of the virus in Italy. Our study highlights the importance of environmental surveillance as an early warning system, to monitor the levels of virus circulating in the population and identify outbreaks even before cases are notified to the healthcare system.},

	abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARs-CoV-2 was considered to be transmitted person to person via droplet infections and fecal-oral transmission. To determine this, we used the existing polio environment surveillance network in Pakistan to investigate presence of SARs-CoV-2 using three commercially available kits and E-Gene detection published assay for surety and confirmatory of positivity. A Two-phase separation method is used for sample clarification and concentration. Before proceeding directly for RNA extraction, an additional high-speed centrifugation (14000Xg for 30 min) step was introduced to increase viral RNA yield resulting decrease in Cq value. A total of 78 wastewater samples collected from 38 districts across Pakistan, 74 wastewater samples from existing polio environment surveillance sites, 3 from drains of COVID-19 infected areas and 1 from COVID 19 quarantine center drainage, were tested for presence of SARs-CoV-2. 21 wastewater samples (27\%) from 13 districts turned to be positive on RT-qPCR. SARs-COV-2 RNA positive samples from areas with COVID patients and COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage strengthen the findings and use of wastewater surveillance in future. Furthermore, sequence data of partial ORF 1a generated from COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage sample also reinforce our findings that SARs-CoV-2 can be detected in wastewater. This study finding indicates that SARs-CoV-2 detection through wastewater surveillance has an epidemiologic potential that can be used as early warning system to monitor viral tracking and circulation in cities with lower COVID-19 disease burden or heavily populated areas where door-to-door tracing may not be possible. However, attention needed on virus concentration and detection assay to increase the sensitivity. Development of highly sensitive assay will be an indicator for virus monitoring and to provide early warning signs. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement Not Applicable \#\#\# Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

	abstract = {Background: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), current case definitions presume mainly lower respiratory tract infection. However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100\%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This work was funded by grants from the German Ministry of Research (01KI1723A) and the European Union (602525) to C.

	abstract = {Background: Cocaine use seems to be increasing in some urban areas worldwide, but it is not straightforward to determine the real extent of this phenomenon. Trends in drug abuse are currently estimated indirectly, mainly by large-scale social, medical, and crime statistics that may be biased or too generic. We thus tested a more direct approach based on 'field' evidence of cocaine use by the general population. Methods: Cocaine and its main urinary metabolite (benzoylecgonine, BE) were measured by mass spectrometry in water samples collected from the River Po and urban waste water treatment plants of medium-size Italian cities. Drug concentration, water flow rate, and population at each site were used to estimate local cocaine consumption. Results: We showed that cocaine and BE are present, and measurable, in surface waters of populated areas. The largest Italian river, the Po, with a five-million people catchment basin, steadily carried the equivalent of about 4 kg cocaine per day. This would imply an average daily use of at least 27 ± 5 doses (100 mg each) for every 1000 young adults, an estimate that greatly exceeds official national figures. Data from waste water treatment plants serving medium-size Italian cities were consistent with this figure. Conclusion: This paper shows for the first time that an illicit drug, cocaine, is present in the aquatic environment, namely untreated urban waste water and a major river. We used environmental cocaine levels for estimating collective consumption of the drug, an approach with the unique potential ability to monitor local drug abuse trends in real time, while preserving the anonymity of individuals. The method tested here - in principle extendable to other drugs of abuse - might be further refined to become a standardized, objective tool for monitoring drug abuse. © 2005 Zuccato et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Tar compounds produced during gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) hinder downstream utilization of syngas. This study investigated the effects of operating conditions (temperature, equivalence air ratio (ER) and MSW moisture content) during gasification using air on tar emissions. Tar was quantified by gravimetric and GC-MS methods, denoted as gravimetric and collected (GC-MS) tar, respectively. Additionally, styrene evolution was studied as it is one of the main tar compounds produced from MSW. By applying the response surface methodology for modeling, it was found that tar contents quantified by the two methods are influenced similarly by ER and MSW moisture content, but differently by temperature. This discrepancy was attributed to the different composition and properties of tar fractions measured by gravimetric and GC-MS methods. Since the selection of analytical method can have impact on the quantification of tar, adoption of different methods for the characterization of tar emissions from MSW gasifiers is essential in order to provide a holistic analysis of the tar evolution process. The content of styrene in collected (GC-MS) tar from MSW gasification was 13–29\%. The lower contents of styrene were favored by operating temperature between 850 and 900 °C, higher ER and higher MSW moisture content.},

	abstract = {A novel, cost-effective and real-time process monitoring and control system was developed to maintain stable operation of waste-to-energy gasification process. It comprised a feedback loop control that utilized the differential temperatures of the oxidation and reduction zones in the gasifier to determine the regional heat-flow (endothermic or exothermic), to assess the availability of oxidizing agent (for instance, air or O2) at the char bed and to calculate the fuel feeding rate. Based on the correlations developed, the air-to-fuel ratio or the equivalence air ratio (ER) for air gasification could be instantaneously adjusted to maintain stable operation of the gasifier. This study demonstrated a simplification of complex reaction dynamics in the gasification process to differential temperature profiling of the gasifier. The monitoring and control system was tested for more than 70 h of continuous operation in a downdraft fixed-bed gasifier with refuse-derived fuel (RDF) prepared from municipal solid wastes (MSW). With the system, fuel feeding rate could be adjusted accurately to stabilize the operating temperature and ER in the gasifier and generate syngas with consistent properties. Significant reductions in the fluctuations of temperature profiles at oxidation and reduction zones (from higher than 100 °C to lower than 50 °C), differential temperatures (from ±200 to ±50 °C) in gasifier and the flow rate (from 16 ± 6.5 to 12 ± 1.8 L/min), composition of main gas components, LHV (from 6.2 ± 3.1 to 5.7 ± 1.6 MJ/Nm3) and tar content (from 8.0 ± 9.7 to 7.5 ± 4.2 g/Nm3) of syngas were demonstrated. The developed gasifier monitoring and control system is adaptable to various types (updraft, downdraft, and fluidized-bed) and scales (lab, pilot, large scale) of gasifiers with different types of fuel.},

	abstract = {The Eurofins Covid-19 SentinelTM program was developed to monitor the evolution of the pandemic and for early detection of outbreaks. The study objective was to develop a wastewater testing method to analyze SARS-CoV-2 as an indicator of community infection rate resurgence of COVID-19 or in well-defined sites such as production facilities or nursing homes. Eurofins performed \&amp;gt;700 tests on 78 unique samples from 18 sites in Denmark, France and Belgium. Ten variant test protocols were trialed. Protocol variations trialed included centrifugation, precipitation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, agitation prior to precipitation, cooling, and pasteurization of the samples. A method was succesfully developed and reliability was supported by stability, reproducibility, and dilution \&amp;amp; linearity studies. Results obtained showed a direct link to number of RNA copies in the sample using a calibration curve with synthetic SARS-CoV-2. Analysis was performed on both the liquid phase and solid phase of wastewater samples, with virus RNA detected in both phases but more frequently in the liquid phase. The virus was present in a sample from a Danish community wastewater treatment plant collected on February 24, 3 days before the first COVID-19 case was officially reported in the country. The greatest concentration of virus detected corresponded to when the COVID-19 crisis was at its peak in Denmark. Based on studies carried out in a Danish hospital, the wastewater testing method is expected to be able to detect a community COVID-19 prevalence rate as low as a 0,02\%-0,1\% (i.e. between 2 virus shedders per 10000 and 1 virus shedder per 1000). The wastewater testing method was used to monitor a Danish Community after a COVID-19 outbreak and it was shown that the method can be used as a semi-quantitative method to monitor the development of an outbreak.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Trialthe study didn\&\#039;t involve patient, therefore there is no need of clinical IDFunding Statementno external funding was receivedAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:No clinical work was performed so IRB was not requiredAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Statistical regression models from the viral load detected in the wastewater and the epidemiological data from A Coruna health system that allowed us to estimate the number of infected people, including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, with reliability close to 90\%, were developed. These models can help to understand the real magnitude of the epidemic in a population at any given time and can be used as an effective early warning tool for predicting outbreaks.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

	abstract = {Background: Wastewater monitoring for virus infections within communities can complement conventional clinical surveillance. Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 testing is performed during clinical encounters with symptomatic individuals, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance and can effectively surveil communities with less temporal lag than other surveillance methods. However, epidemiologically-defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Methods: Herein we describe methods for developing a geographically-resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky which may have general applicability for cities throughout the United States. This approach was developed by the selection of sampling locations along sewer lines transporting raw wastewater from geographically and demographically distinct areas that correspond with locations where random testing of residents occurs. Conclusions: Development of this protocol for population-level sampling for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater can be utilized to inform consistent wastewater monitoring among cities for up-to-date and geographically-resolved information on COVID-19 prevalence within communities. This information could substantially supplement public health surveillance of COVID-19 and thus serve to better guide targeted mitigation strategies throughout the United States. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This work was supported in part by grants from the James Graham Brown Foundation and the Owsley Brown Family Foundation. \#\#\# Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

	abstract = {The primary concentration and molecular process are critical to implement wastewater-based epidemiology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the previously developed methods were optimized for nonenveloped viruses. Few studies evaluated if the methods are applicable to the efficient recovery of enveloped viruses from various types of raw sewage. This study aims (1) to compare the whole process recovery of Pseudomonas phage φ6, a surrogate for enveloped viruses, among combinations of primary concentration [ultrafiltration (UF), electronegative membrane vortex (EMV), and polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG)] and RNA extraction methods (spin column-based method using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and acid guanidinium thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform extraction using TRIzol reagent) for three types of raw sewage and (2) to test the applicability of the method providing the highest φ6 recovery to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among the tested combinations, PEG+TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery ratio of 29.8\% to 49.8\% (geometric mean). UF + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided the second highest φ6 recovery of 6.4\% to 35.8\%. The comparable φ6 recovery was observed for UF + TRIzol (13.8–30.0\%). PEG + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided only 1.4\% to 3.0\% of φ6 recovery, while coliphage MS2, a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses, was recovered comparably with PEG + TRIzol. This indicated that the nonenveloped surrogate (MS2) did not necessarily validate the efficient recovery for enveloped viruses. EMV + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided significantly different φ6 recovery (1.6–21\%) among the types of raw sewage. Then, the applicability of modified PEG + TRIzol was examined for the raw sewage collected in Tokyo, Japan. Of the 12 grab samples, 4 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 CDC N1 and N3 assay. Consequently, PEG + TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery and allowed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from raw sewage.},

Earlier reports have suggested that COVID-19 agents can be present in the sewage samples and thus it can be a good indication of the pandemic extent in a community. However, no such studies have been reported in the Indian context. Hence, it becomes absolutely necessary to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving different localities of Jaipur city. Samples from different WWTPs and hospital wastewater samples were collected and wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) studies were carried out using the RT-PCR to confirm the presence of different COVID-19 target genes namely S gene, E gene, ORF1ab gene, RdRp gene and N gene. The results revealed that the untreated wastewater samples showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, which was correlated with the increased number of COVID-19 positive patients from the concerned areas, as reported in the publically available health data. This is the first study that investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in wastewater, at higher ambient temperature (45 °C), further validating WBE as potential tool in predicting and mitigating outbreaks.},

High viral loads are found at the sewage pipeline or at the entrance of wastewater treatment plants from cities where the number of COVID-19 cases are significant. In Quito (Ecuador) as in many other cities worldwide, wastewater is directly discharged into natural waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 target regions) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target regions in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2. The high values detected in natural waters from a low sanitation region have several implications in health and ecology that should be further assessed.},

Tracking the spread of the virus raised a main concern in every country. Many researches proved the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples of patients, where the genes of this virus gave a positive signal several days prior to the occurrence of symptoms. The fact of viral shedding in stools provides an advantage in utilizing wastewater systems as a tool to monitor the viral prevalence. We tested more than 2900 municipal wastewater samples coming from 49 distinctive area in Dubai, where 28.6\% showed positive results. We also looked into the wastewater samples from 198 commercial aircrafts arriving at Dubai Airport, giving a positive result percentage of 13.6\%. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genes was confirmed using TaqPath™ Covid-19 RT-PCR kit, which targets ORF1ab, N gene and S gene. This project shows the significance of utilizing wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in monitoring the prevalence of various infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, which can assist the decision makers to determine the level of precautionary measures according to the areas of the outbreak. With this in mind, pricewise, WBE is considered cost-effective when comparing to clinical nasal swabs.},

This study aimed to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage in Mexico based on RdRP, S, and N gene analysis. The influent, effluent, and activated sludge from two domestic wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) were evaluated from the early stage of the epidemic to July 2020. Additionally, sampling points in sewer systems were examined, comparing two different RNA-concentration methods: centrifugal ultrafiltration and adsorption-based methods. The adsorption method resulted in RNA titration that was two orders of magnitude higher than with ultrafiltration (up to 3.38 log10 copies RdRP gene/mL of sewage). The surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent of two WWTP correlated with the cumulative COVID-19 cases in Queretaro city. The higher RNA level in secondary sludge compared to influent suggests that viral RNA becomes concentrated in activated sludge. This result supports SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal in WWTP, where all effluent samples were negative for virus quantification. This work proves that wastewater-based epidemiology is a very valuable tool in developing countries where diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are limited.},

This approach can be particularly helpful in understanding outbreaks of disease like the novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) when combined with clinical datasets. In this study, three RT-ddPCR assays (N1, N2, N3) were used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in weekly samples from nine WWTPs in southeastern Virginia. In the first several weeks of sampling, SARS-CoV-2 detections were sporadic. Frequency of detections and overall concentrations of RNA within samples increased from mid March into late July. During the twenty-one week study, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged from 101 to 104 copies 100 mL−1 in samples where viral RNA was detected. Fluctuations in population normalized loading rates in several of the WWTP service areas agreed with known outbreaks during the study. Here we propose several ways that data can be presented spatially and temporally to be of greatest use to public health officials. As the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, it is likely that communities will see increased incidence of small, localized outbreaks. In these instances, WBE could be used as a pre-screening tool to better target clinical testing needs in communities with limited resources.},

Given the presence of viral RNA in feces in around 40\% of infected persons, wastewater-based epidemiology has been proposed as an addition to disease-based surveillance to assess the spread of the virus at the community level. Here we have explored the possibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sewage samples to evaluate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level from routine wastewater testing, and compared these results with the virus diversity in patients from the Netherlands and Belgium. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of viruses belonging to the most prevalent clades (19A, 20A and 20B) in both countries. Clades 19B and 20C were not identified, while they were present in clinical samples during the same period. Low frequency variant (LFV) analysis showed that some known LFVs can be associated with particular clusters within a clade, different to those of their consensus sequences, suggesting the presence of at least 2 clades within a single sewage sample. Additionally, combining genome consensus and LFV analyses we found a total of 57 unique mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which have not been described before. In conclusion, this work illustrates how NGS analysis of wastewater can be used to approximate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in a community.},

	abstract = {This work studied the feasibility of co-gasification of biosolids with biomass as a means of disposal with energy recovery. The kinetics study at 800°C showed that biomass, such as switchgrass, could catalyze the reactions because switchgrass ash contained a high proportion of potassium, an excellent catalyst for gasification. However, biosolids could also inhibit gasification due to interaction between biomass alkali/alkaline earth metals and biosolids clay minerals. In the pilot scale experiments, increasing the proportion of biosolids in the feedstock affected gasification performance negatively. Syngas yield and char conversion decreased from 1.38 to 0.47m3/kg and 82-36\% respectively as the biosolids proportion in the fuel increased from 0\% to 100\%. Over the same range, the tar content increased from 10.3 to 200g/m3, while the ammonia concentration increased from 1660 to 19,200ppmv. No more than 25\% biosolids in the fuel feed is recommended to maintain a reasonable gasification.},

	abstract = {Cogasification of sewage sludge mixed with coal showed that the amount of sewage sludge supplied to the gasifier, depending on its availability, could vary without affecting the gasifier performance; however, it had an influence on the syngas composition. The use of sewage sludge during coal gasification gave rise to an increasing gas yield and energy conversion, mainly because the gas produced had a greater hydrocarbon content. H2S, HCl, and especially NH3 were also found to increase, due to higher contents of nitrogen in the sewage sludge compared with coal. The rise of both the temperature and the air flow rate resulted in the production of more gas and a lowering of hydrocarbon, char, and tar contents. A decrease in NH3 content was also observed, as the increase of these parameters promoted the destruction of this compound. The rise in the equivalent ratio also led to lower contents of H2S and HCl, probably due to the partial oxidation of these compounds; however, the total amount of these elements released to the gas phase was not considerably affected. On the other hand, H2S formation was favored by the rise in temperature up to 850 °C, while the HCl concentration was not significantly affected. Heavy metals supplied with the fuel were mostly retained in solid residues, with Pb and Hg being the most volatile at 850 °C. However, the leachability of these metals was found to be below the analytical detection levels, and only small quantities of SO42- and Cl- were released. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {This is the study of environmental implications of sewage sludge cogasification mixed with biomass wastes (straw pellets). NH3, H2S, and HCl contents of syngas were compared to those produced during cogasification of sewage sludge with coal. In the presence of straw pellets, lower concentrations of NH3 and higher contents of HCl were obtained, probably due to its low and high contents of N and Cl, respectively. However, NH3 and HCl contents in the syngas were very low and similar for both sewage sludge blends with straw pellets or with coal, because most of these compounds were retained in the condensation system of the gasification installation. Lower H2S levels were also measured when blends of sewage sludge with straw pellets were used, probably due to the lower sulfur contents of straw pellets. The results obtained show that it is possible to cogasify sewage sludge with either biomass, such as straw pellets, or coal, without major modifications in previously existing gasification installations. However, because the release of undesirable S, N, and Cl compounds is most affected by the contents of these elements in the fuels, special care should be taken when substituting one fuel for another and an adjustment of experimental conditions is most advisable. The results obtained showed that sewage sludge should be cogasified with straw pellets to take profit of its diluting effect, although effective sorbents could be added to the gasification medium to achieve further reductions of sulfur compound release. Gasification solid residues were analyzed to evaluate possible reuses and leachability behavior. The leachability tests performed according to European regulations showed that metals leachability was within the limits for landfilling inert residues, but chlorine release could be very high, especially in the presence of straw pellets, due to its high chlorine content. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge disposal is troublesome because of the presence of microbes, toxins, and heavy metals in it. Co-gasification of sewage sludge with wood is a promising pathway to dispose of sewage sludge and generate usable syngas, simultaneously. By using a sorbent for in situ sorption of CO2, H2 fraction in the generated syngas can be enhanced considerably. An equilibrium model was developed taking wood and sewage sludge as the model compounds and CaO as the sorbent. This evaluation was performed by employing ASPEN PLUS (V 8.8) software. Principle of Gibbs free-energy minimization was adopted to predict the outlet gas composition and gas yield. The impact of reactor temperature (600 to 900 °C) and sludge content (0 to 100 wt \% at 700 °C) in the feedstock on syngas yield and constituents were assessed. With 30 wt \% sludge, maximum gas yield was observed as 0.526 kg h-1 at 900 °C while minimum CO2 fraction was achieved at 700 °C. At 700 °C, the highest gas yield of 0.251 kg h-1 was recorded at 50 wt \% sludge, whereas minimum CO2 concentration was observed at 30 wt \% sludge. The model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental findings. The study reflects that CO2-sorption enhanced gasification of sewage sludge with other biomass such as wood is an attractive option to dispose of sewage sludge in an environmental friendly manner and to generate hydrogen-rich fuel gas.},

The results showed that the optimal low heating value (LHV) of fuel gas of 6.83 MJ/Nm3, CGE of 70.68\%, and low tar content of 5.84 g/Nm3 were obtained at 800 °C, SS content of 50 wt \%, CaO/C (molar ratio) of 1.0, and ER of 0.22. A high temperature was favorable for high-quality gas production, and the optimum temperature was 800 °C, at which CaO mainly played the catalyst role but not the CO2 sorbent. Synergetic effects occurred in the co-gasification, and gas quality could be improved in an appropriate proportion by blending 50 wt \% SS with AHR. ER ranging from 0.20 to 0.22 improved gas quality and CGE; however, a higher ER favored the decrease of the tar content, and the optimal tar content of 4.00 g/Nm3 was obtained with ER = 0.30.

The use of a TZFBR enables both the catalytic upgrading of the gasification gas and the regeneration of the catalyst deactivated by coke deposition in a single vessel. Both an increase of 37\% of gas LHV and a reduction of tar compounds to nondetectable levels are achieved in the best conditions used, with a 2 vol \% of oxygen in the regeneration flow. Dolomite was used in the desulfurization unit at 800 C, allowing the reduction of the H2S content in the produced gas from 1100 ppm to less than 300 ppm, and a tar reduction from 15 g/m3(STP) to 0.2 g/m 3(STP).

The aim of the current study was to learn about the influence of these three catalysts in the product distribution and tar production during sewage sludge gasification. To this end, a set of assays was performed in which the temperature (750-850 °C), the in-bed catalyst content (0, 10 and 15 wt.\%) and the steam-biomass ratio (SB) in the range of 0-1 were varied with a constant equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.3. The results were compared to the results from gasification without a catalyst. We show that dolomite has the highest activity in tar elimination, followed by alumina and olivine.

	abstract = {Sewage sludge is the residue produced by the domestic or industrial wastewaters treatment plants. According to the principles of sustainability, several restrictions have been imposed on the conventional methods currently adopted for its disposal. The consequent need to develop alternative processes for the use of sewage sludge for energy purposes such as gasification requires experimental tests in order to quantify the potential energy recover from this waste, as well as to evaluate the optimum conditions for its gasification. In the present study, the gasification with air of dehydrated sewage sludge (20 wt.\% moisture) mixed with conventional woody biomass was performed in a pilot scale updraft fixed-bed gasifier operating at atmospheric pressure. Attention was focused on the effect of the sewage sludge content and the equivalent ratio (ratio between the amount of air used and the stoichiometric air needed for combustion) on the product yields, gas composition and cold gas efficiency. The results obtained showed that it is possible to cogasify sewage sludge with wood pellets in pre-existing updraft fixed-bed gasification installations. However, at high sewage sludge content (≥70 w/w\%) slagging and an excessive clinker formation may occur in the oxidation zone because of the high ash content and low ash fusion temperatures of the sludge making the gasification process unstable. In addition, the formation of an ash layer on the grate requires persistent ash discharge that introduces instabilities in the gasifier operating conditions. The rise in the equivalent ratio led to higher gas and carbon yields and cold gas efficiencies. At the optimal equivalent ratio of 0.25, compared with wood pellets gasification, the addition of sewage sludge with 20 wt.\% moisture up to 70 w/w\% gave rise to decreasing the dry gas yield from 1.56 to 1.07 Nm 3/kg of feedstock due to the higher moisture and ash content of sewage sludge and to moderate reductions of the gas lower heating value and cold gas efficiency from 5.8to4.9MJ/Nmdry3 and from 60\% to 55\%, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

When the temperature inside the reactor was stable, oxygen and steam of the temperature of approximately 100 °C were introduced into the reactor. In the second system, after the reactor was heated up to 700 °C, the heating of the reactor was switched off and oxygen and steam were pre-heated to the temperature of 700 °C and fed into the reactor. In the third system a fuel sample in the reactor was heated to the temperature 700 °C and the set temperature was maintained with the resistance furnace. The results showed that sufficient thermal energy required for an effective oxygen/steam gasification process was generated in systems with the external heating of the reactor. The highest hydrogen contents in gas were reported in coal gasification, irrespective of the system configuration. The total hydrogen volume decreased with increasing biomass content in a fuel blend in all studied system configurations.},

The results indicated that the thermal reaction activity is increased with an increase in the amount of sewage sludge. This is due to the sewage sludge contains less fixed carbon content could decrease the activation energy, resulting in a thermal reaction is significantly enhanced. The synthetic gas (syngas) composition, that includes H2 and CO, ranged from percentages of 2.59\%–4.13\% and 3.2\%–6.91\%, respectively. The heating value of the produced gas ranged from 1.67 MJ/Nm3 to 2.56 MJ/Nm3, which was coupled with cold gas efficiency (CGE) that ranged from 46.6\% to 77\%. In the case of two tons of wet tested sludge with 67\% moisture content, it could produce one ton of dry tested sludge with 30\% moisture content after a drying process, and produce approximately 2.2 tons of syngas in gasification. After using a boiler and heat exchanger for energy recovery, it is possible to recover 4.46 tons of steam. This steam could provide energy for the dryer, and constitutes a positive sum on the energy balance in a commercial scale gasification plant.},

	abstract = {In the present work, the gasification with air of dehydrated sewage sludge (SS) with 20wt.\% moisture mixed with conventional woody biomass was investigated using a pilot fixed-bed updraft gasifier. Attention was focused on the effect of the SS content on the gasification performance and on the environmental impact of the process. The results showed that it is possible to co-gasify SS with wood pellets (WPs) in updraft fixed-bed gasification installations. However, at high content of sewage sludge the gasification process can become instable because of the very high ash content and low ash fusion temperatures of SS. At an equivalent ratio of 0.25, compared with wood pellets gasification, the addition of sewage sludge led to a reduction of gas yield in favor of an increase of condensate production with consequent cold gas efficiency decrease. Low concentrations of dioxins/furans and PAHs were measured in the gas produced by SS gasification, well below the limiting values for the exhaust gaseous emissions. NH3, HCl and HF contents were very low because most of these compounds were retained in the wet scrubber systems. On the other hand, high H2S levels were measured due to high sulfur content of SS. Heavy metals supplied with the feedstocks were mostly retained in gasification solid residues. The leachability tests performed according to European regulations showed that metals leachability was within the limits for landfilling inert residues. On the other hand, sulfate and chloride releases were found to comply with the limits for non-hazardous residues. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The properties of the hydrochar derived from co-HTC of sewage sludge (SS) and sawdust (SD), and CO2 gasification characteristics of the hydrochar were investigated. The results showed that the hydrochar had enhanced aromatic degree and increased metals content compared to raw sludge. The hydrochar also exhibited an enhanced gasification reactivity, resulting in high carbon monoxide content in the syngas than that from SS under identical conditions. The temperature and SD/SS mass ratio had a significant influence on the syngas composition mainly by the Boudouard reaction and water gas reaction. The gasification reactivity was strongly associated with the inorganic elements, and the KAlSi3O8 inhibited while the K2CO3 promoted the gasification reaction of hydrochars. Under optimal conditions, a high gasification efficiency of 77.73\% was obtained, and the lower heating value of the syngas reached 8.15 MJ/Nm3.

Their gasification properties were further experimentally evaluated. The results showed that the hydrochar was more hydrophobic than the pyrochar. The hydrochar was rich in nitrogen-containing functional groups and increased nickel, iron, alkali and alkaline earth metallic species compared to the raw sludge and pyrochar. It enhanced the interactions between the carbon surface and hydrogen bonding as well as gasification reactivity of the hydrochar, thus resulting in a higher hydrogen concentration and yield than the pyrochar under identical conditions. Additionally, the hydrochar had a more porous structure on the surface, facilitating the pores better accessible for condensable hydrocarbon molecules and thus improved the gas production and gasification efficiency. Although the energy recovery efficiency of LTP-gasification method was higher than that of HTC-gasification approach, the total energy consumption during the HTC pretreatment combined with subsequent gasification was lower than the energy evolved in the corresponding product gas in most gasification conditions. This study demonstrates that the integration of HTC pretreatment and subsequent gasification has promising potential for hydrogen-rich syngas production from sewage sludge.},

As the thermal conversion of sewage sludge (combustion, co-combustion, gasification and pyrolysis) appears to be the most promising alternative for its management, the solid residues left after gasification were examined. The present study evaluates the potential of this waste as an alternative phosphorus source in the context of phosphorus recovery. The obtained solid gasification residues were characterised (chemical and phase composition, thermal properties, surface properties and technological parameters used for phosphorus raw materials) and compared to commercial phosphate raw materials. It was revealed that gasification residue is a valuable source of phosphorus and microelements, comparable to sewage sludge ash (SSA) considered nowadays as secondary phosphorus raw materials. Chemical properties as well as technological parameters characteristic for natural phosphate ores are different. Solid gasification residue was leached with mineral acids (phosphoric and nitric) according to the patented method of phosphorus recovery - PolFerAsh, developed by Cracow University of Technology. It was revealed that phosphorus can be selectively leached from solid gasification residue with high efficiency (73–82\%); moreover, most of the iron and heavy metals stay in the solid phase due to the low concentration of acids and proper solid to liquid phase ratio. The obtained leachates are valuable products that can be considered for the production of fertilisers. Combining the gasification process with nutrient recovery provides the opportunity for more environmentally efficient technologies driven by sustainable development rules.},

A combined gasification and incineration process for the disposal of dried sewage sludge was tested in a pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifier and a down-flow combustor (DFC). Syngas produced from the CFB gasifier, together with fine solids, was pneumatically transported into the DFC for incineration in order to recover the heating value of the syngas with low nitrogen oxides emission. Measured data indicated that under typical operating conditions, approximately 90\% of fuel-N was released into the gas phase and further reduced to N2 in the gasifier. The NOx concentrations measured in the subsequent incineration process were 220 ± 6 mg/N m3 (corrected to 6 vol\% free O2) due to effective air staging scheme that maintained the temperature in the DFC below 1150 °C. The conversion of fuel-N to NOx was found to be 1 ± 0.04\%, based on elemental mass balance. The combustible content in the fly ash collected from the DFC was 2.8\%, corresponding to an overall combustion efficiency of 99.2\% in the system.

	abstract = {Regulatory changes in the EU and Germany, and environmental aspects direct the attention of the agricultural and energy sector towards sewage sludge as a new resource. The present study evaluates the co-gasification of sewage sludge with brown coal in a slagging gasifier. Currently, a lack of experimental data on phosphorous containing ashes and slags under reducing atmospheres limits our understanding of gasification of this fuel. To address this gap, in this study the ash and slag properties of one brown coal and its mixtures with sewage sludge were experimentally investigated under a reducing atmosphere and predicted with FactSage™. An ASPENplus™ simulation of the co-gasification is conducted to evaluate the impact of the changing feedstock characteristics on major process parameters when different mixtures of sewage sludge and brown coal are fed into a Siemens gasifier. The flow temperature of the coal ash can noticeably be reduced if the sewage sludge ash content is increased up to 50 wt\%. Thermochemical calculations using FactSage™ are in good agreement with the experimental ash fusion behavior. This paper describes a method to improve the calculation to better fit the experimental values. The elemental liberation of the main ash components are modeled using FactSage™ and experimentally validated. Except for potassium, no significant release into the gas phase was detected in the experiment. This is in contrast to the predicted evaporation of phosphorous. The addition of sewage sludge results in a lower viscosity of the slags of the mixtures in this study. As a result, the studied entrained-flow gasifier can be operated at lower temperatures while staying at an optimal viscosity for slag tapping. On the other hand, it decreases the temperature working range inside a slagging gasifier, where the slag viscosity lies between 2 and 25 Pa s. The resulting implications on the process parameters of entrained flow gasification have been modeled with ASPENplus™. Even low sewage sludge additions to the brown coal allow for lower gasifier temperatures, decreasing the specific oxygen consumption. Moreover, the cold gas efficiency and the H2/CO ratio are increased.},

In this work, solid residuals from thermal gasification and co-gasification of municipal sewage sludge were investigated for their potential use as fertilizer. Ashes from five different low temperature circulating fluidized bed (LT-CFB) gasification campaigns including two mono-sludge campaigns, two sludge/straw mixed fuels campaigns and a straw reference campaign were compared. Experiments were conducted on two different LT-CFBs with thermal capacities of 100 kW and 6 MW, respectively. The assessment included: (i) Elemental composition and recovery of key elements and heavy metals; (ii) content of total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N); (iii) pH; (iv) water extractability of phosphorus after incubation in soil; and (v) plant phosphorus response measured in a pot experiment with the most promising ash material. Co-gasification of straw and sludge in LT-CFB gasifiers produced ashes with a high content of recalcitrant C, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), a low content of heavy metals (especially cadmium) and an improved plant P availability compared to the mono-sludge ashes, thereby showing the best fertilizer qualities among all assessed materials. It was also found that bottom ashes from the char reactor contained even less heavy metals than cyclone ashes. It is concluded that LT-CFB gasification and co-gasification is a highly effective way to purify and sanitize sewage sludge for subsequent use in agricultural systems.},

The results are then used for an FWO activation energy estimation, synergistic effect analysis, and gas yield analysis.

Gasification temperature of coal char is much higher than that of MSW char, and addition of MSW can significantly improve the gasification reactivity of BC. Besides, a significant synergistic effect is observed for all the blends in char gasification stage. Based on three kinetic methods of Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (Xie et al., 2018), Starink (Zhang et al., 2019a) and Friedman, the minimum average activation energy Ea (184.13 kJ/mol) is obtained when the blend ratio of BC is 40\% which might be an optimal option for co-gasification of the blends. The average values of the enthalpy, the Gibbs function and the entropy changes for sample 60MSW40BC are 176.82 kJ/mol, 257.89 kJ/mol and −89.16 J/mol·K, respectively. According to the Malek method, F6, A1 and D7 models are probably more suitable to describe three main stages of sample 60MSW40BC CO2 co-gasification.},

	abstract = {With the advent of a series of science and policy concerns about global warming, attention has been paid on clean power generation with low or even negative CO2 emission. Bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration technologies can produce heat and power whilst removing CO2 indirectly from air, but it suffers low energy efficiency and poor economy. To improve the performance so that it can be practically used in industry, a series of research is done in this work. A bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration superstructure is put forward. Three representative schemes, including a biomass-fired power plant, a biomass-fueled integrated gasification combined cycle and a biomass-fueled integrated gasification fuel cell system are constructed and compared thermodynamically with the assistance of the commercial software Aspen Plus. It is found that the net electric efficiencies of the biomass-fired power plant, the biomass-fueled integrated gasification combined cycle and the biomass-fueled integrated gasification fuel cell are 30.7\%, 44.5\% and 50.5\%. The electric power generation per unit biomass consumption of the three systems can be 1.37 kWh/kg, 1.98 kWh/kg and 2.31 kWh/kg. The costs of electricity produced by the three systems are 0.0584 \$/kWh, 0.0497 \$/kWh and 0.0493 \$/kWh. The CO2 mitigation rate per unit power generation of the three systems can be 0.943 kg/kWh, 0.629 kg/kWh and 0.567 kg/kWh. All these findings indicate that the biomass-fueled integrated gasification fuel cell system is promising for future clean power generation with negative CO2 emission.},

	abstract = {Biofuels from biomass gasification are reviewed here, and demonstrated to be an attractive option. Recent progress in gasification techniques and key generation pathways for biofuels production, process design and integration and socio-environmental impacts of biofuel generation are discussed, with the goal of investigating gasification-to-biofuels’ credentials as a sustainable and eco-friendly technology. The synthesis of important biofuels such as bio-methanol, bio-ethanol and higher alcohols, bio-dimethyl ether, Fischer Tropsch fuels, bio-methane, bio-hydrogen and algae-based fuels is reviewed, together with recent technologies, catalysts and reactors. Significant thermodynamic studies for each biofuel are also examined. Syngas cleaning is demonstrated to be a critical issue for biofuel production, and innovative pathways such as those employed by Choren Industrietechnik, Germany, and BioMCN, the Netherlands, are shown to allow efficient methanol generation. The conversion of syngas to FT transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co or Fe catalysts is reviewed and demonstrated to be a promising option for the future of biofuels. Bio-methane has emerged as a lucrative alternative for conventional transportation fuel with all the advantages of natural gas including a dense distribution, trade and supply network. Routes to produce H2 are discussed, though critical issues such as storage, expensive production routes with low efficiencies remain. Algae-based fuels are in the research and development stage, but are shown to have immense potential to become commercially important because of their capability to fix large amounts of CO2, to rapidly grow in many environments and versatile end uses. However, suitable process configurations resulting in optimal plant designs are crucial, so detailed process integration is a powerful tool to optimize current and develop new processes. LCA and ethical issues are also discussed in brief. It is clear that the use of food crops, as opposed to food wastes represents an area fraught with challenges, which must be resolved on a case by case basis.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary The kinetics of coal gasification is a subject of intensive investigation. Despite this, the results of such investigations have to date flowed into the design procedures for commercial gasification reactors to only a limited extent. This chapter discusses kinetic theory wherein the basic ideas and an indication of how and where appropriate application of kinetic theory could help in the design of future reactors are explored. In the section on kinetics, devolatilization, volatiles combustion, and char gasification are discussed. In the coke oven, a batch of coal is indirectly heated via the side walls in a relatively flat vertical oven where devolatilization takes place. Such a batch process can also be made semi-continuous, as is the case in a coal stove for domestic use and a moving-bed gasifier or fully continuous, as in large-scale grate-type furnaces as applied in power stations and industry. Subsequent section discusses plug flow reactors (PFR) and continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Following this, applications to reactor design are explained. Applications are emerging where their incorporation into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is proving to be of practical material benefit.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary The future of gasification is intimately intertwined with the future of energy and energy policy. It is generally recognized that human development cannot continue to base its economy on fossil fuels in the present manner forever, even if viewpoints on the timescale do diverge, sometimes dramatically. This viewpoint is called the hydrogen economy. However, the “paper” also proposes that hydrogen that can be used in fuel cells is not suitable as of now, as it is chemically locked into other substances, the principle of which is water and to a lesser extent, natural gas. There are essentially three routes to hydrogen production: electrolysis of water, steam reforming of natural gas, and gasification, whereby the fuel for the gasification can be anything from coal to biomass. In the transition between fossil fuels and a renewable world, gasification can play an important role. Furthermore, during this transition period the implementation of poly generation units producing both power and hydrogen will allow a gradual change over from the former to the latter. This is the only way in which an investment in power generation can be utilized for hydrogen production at moderate cost.},

	abstract = {In recent years, photovoltaic cell technology has grown extraordinarily as a sustainable source of energy, as a consequence of the increasing concern over the impact of fossil fuel-based energy on global warming and climate change. The different photovoltaic cells developed up to date can be classified into four main categories called generations (GEN), and the current market is mainly covered by the first two GEN. The 1GEN (mono or polycrystalline silicon cells and gallium arsenide) comprises well-known medium/low cost technologies that lead to moderate yields. The 2GEN (thin-film technologies) includes devices that have lower efficiency albeit are cheaper to manufacture. The 3GEN presents the use of novel materials, as well as a great variability of designs, and comprises expensive but very efficient cells. The 4GEN, also known as “inorganics-in-organics”, combines the low cost/flexibility of polymer thin films with the stability of novel inorganic nanostructures (i.e., metal nanoparticles and metal oxides) with organic-based nanomaterials (i.e., carbon nanotubes, graphene and its derivatives), and are currently under investigation. The main goal of this review is to show the current state of art on photovoltaic cell technology in terms of the materials used for the manufacture, efficiency and production costs. A comprehensive comparative analysis of the four generations is performed, including the device architectures, their advantages and limitations. Special emphasis is placed on the 4GEN, where the diverse roles of the organic and nano-components are discussed. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives are summarized.},

Most of the other books currently available are targeted towards the experienced users and contain too many details and/or contain knowledge at a fairly high level. This book provides a brief and clear overview of the combustion basics, suitable for beginners and then focuses on practical aspects, rather than theory, illustrated by a number of industrial applications as examples. The content is aimed to provide a general understanding of the various concepts, techniques and equipment for students at all level as well as practitioners with little or no prior experience in the field. The authors are all international experts in the field of combustion technology and adopt here a clear didactic style with many practical examples to cover the most common solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. The associated environmental impacts are also discussed so that readers can develop an understanding of the major issues and the options available for more sustainable combustion processes.},

The nanoparticles were characterized for physicochemical properties by multiple morphological and structural methods (e.g., SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, and TPD). The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process was carried out to evaluate the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles on conversion of biomass-derived synthesis gas (bio-syngas) to liquid hydrocarbons. Characterization results revealed that the nanoparticles had core-shell structures with iron in situ encapsulated within a graphitic shell. Moreover, significant amounts of iron carbide (mainly Fe3C) were formed as an interface between the carbonaceous shell and the iron core. FTS tests indicated that such carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles possessed a high activity on conversion of bio-syngas and good selectivity towards liquid hydrocarbons (of which olefins were the dominant product). Over a 1500 h testing period, the nanoparticles showed striking stability against deactivation, with CO conversion maintained at about 95\% and liquid hydrocarbon selectivity at about 68\%. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the utilization of CO2 as carbon neutral chemical feedstock in the thermo-chemical processing (i.e., pyrolysis and gasification) of biomass to enhance sustainability via modification of the composition of end products. To justify the universal function of CO2 in the thermo-chemical process, the biomass experimented on in this work was not limited to ligno-cellulosic biomass; seaweed (i.e., red macroalgae) was used to expand biofuel feedstock beyond terrestrial biomass. Our experimental results validated the achieved enhanced generation of ∼200\% for H2 and ∼1000\% for CO by means of adopting CO2 in the thermo-chemical process, as compared to the case in N2. This can be explained by the enhanced thermal cracking of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) evolved from the thermal degradation of biomass and the reaction between CO2 and VOCs. Considering mass balance under our experimental conditions, we confirmed reaction between CO2 and VOCs, which was universally observed in pyrolysis of all biomass samples used in this work. Thus, the identified influence of CO2 in the thermo-chemical process can be directly applied in a variety of research and industrial fields, which would be environmentally desirable.},

A C++ program was developed to assess ReaxFF trajectories and to analyze elementary reactions involved in the mechanism. Calculated product distribution and relative amounts of main gas products show good agreement with reported experimental observations. We found that the CO formation pathways in the CO2 gasification of lignite begin with the chain carbon radical (Rn), which is formed by C–H/C–C bond cleavage reactions of aromatic moieties in the lignite or produced semicoke at high temperatures. These chain carbon radicals can react with CO2, forming oxidized carbon radicals, such as Rn-O-C-O, Rn-CO2 and Rn-O. Among these radicals, Rn-O and Rn-O-C-O are important precursors of CO. They produce CO molecules by releasing their C-O moieties at the end. The thermodynamic properties of these elementary reactions were obtained by density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(2d,2p) level. The calculated overall enthalpy and entropy changes could clearly explain the experimental data. The density functional theory results show that most of these elementary reactions are endothermic and entropy increasing. High gasification temperatures are favorable for the reactions.},

Earlier literature has focused on the factors that influence the success (or failure) of urban recycling schemes with much work focusing on how the attitudes of households and consumers make or break recycling programs. However, an ambitious national level recycling program is rarely documented. Using the case study of the Singapore National Recycling Programme, I argue that institutional support and infrastructural competence are crucial to the successful implementation of a large-scale urban waste recycling program. Nonetheless, it is also noted that a resilient program needs to accommodate more community-level initiatives and greater, unambiguous emphasis on the environmental justifications for recycling. The Singapore experience demonstrates that technocratic accomplishment in planning is a necessary but insufficient condition for the long-term success of a large-scale recycling program. © 2010 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Despite alarming predictions that global waste will nearly double to 2.2 billion annual tonnes by 2025, and despite the recognition that waste consumes space, the wicked problem of waste as well as its negative impacts have yet to be systematically examined in planning and environmental design. In urban waste management, the landfill is at once the most visible and spatial sign of this worsening problem. In this article, I examine the case of Singapore's offshore Semakau Landfill as an attempt in large-scale environmental modification—the creation of new land or terra nova in the sea—to accommodate waste. As an unprecedented case of environmental design for urban waste, this case brings up various ethical issues encountered in the framing, ‘taming’, and ‘solution’ of this wicked problem. Through this article, I respond to the call for greater insights and knowledge on working with wicked problem in socio-ecological systems today. I explain why ethics is necessary for a better understanding of the wicked problem of waste, which entails not only different adaptive strategies, but also commitments to large-scale environmental design projects. Because wicked problems often demand ‘tragic solutions’ that imply harm, I also apply different ethical frameworks to understand the implications of the Semakau Landfill as a ‘tragic solution’. In all, I argue that the contemporary problem of waste is a wicked problem and how an ethical understanding of this problem can help to avoid the various moral pitfalls of this wicked problem.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the application of life cycle assessment for evaluating various waste management options in Singapore, a small-island city state. The impact assessment method by SimaPro is carried out for comparing the potential environmental impacts of waste treatment options including landfilling, incineration, recycling, and composting. The inventory data include gases and leachate from landfills, air emissions and energy recovery from incinerators, energy (and emission) savings from recycling, composting gases, and transport pollution. The impact assessment results for climate change, acidification, and ecotoxicity show that the incineration of materials imposes considerable harm to both human health and the environment, especially for the burning of plastics, paper/cardboard, and ferrous metals. The results also show that, although some amount of energy can be derived from the incineration of wastes, these benefits are outweighed by the air pollution (heavy metals and dioxins/furans) that incinerators produce. For Singapore, landfill gases and leachate generate minimal environmental damage because of the nation’s policy to landfill only 10\% of the total disposed wastes. Land transportation and separation of waste materials also pose minimal environmental damage. However, sea transportation to the land-fill could contribute significantly to acidification because of the emissions of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides from barges. The composting of horticultural wastes hardly imposes any environmental damage. Out of all the waste strategies, the recycling of wastes offers the best solution for environmental protection and improved human health for the nation. Significant emission savings can be realized through recycling. © 2006 Air \& Waste Management Association.},

However, they present numerous potential applications. Thus, this research is conducted precisely on the characterization of eight chars originating from biomass (waste wood, sawdust, miscanthus wood, and grape marc) and from waste (tires, municipal, and industrial RDF). Four property domains were studied in this research: physicochemical properties (moisture content, pH, skeletal density, and TGA), texture and morphology (SEM/EDX and BET specific surface area), surface chemistry (FTIR), and structure (XRD). Our results showed that the properties of these chars match the properties required in some applications such as soil amendment, catalyst, and water and gas treatment.

	abstract = {Biochar is a carbon-rich organic material that has advantageous physicochemical properties for applications in multidisciplinary areas of science and engineering, including soil amendment, carbon sequestration, bioenergy production, and site rehabilitation. However, the typically low porosity and surface area of biochars (from 0.1 to 500 m2 g−1) limits the suitability for other applications, such as catalysis, electrochemistry, energy storage, and contaminant sorption in drinking water and wastewater. Given the high global demand for activated carbon products, scientists and industrialists are exploring the potential of biochar-derived biomass as precursors for activated carbons. This review presents and discusses the available studies on activated biochars produced from various precursor feedstocks and under different operating conditions in a two-step procedure: pyro-gasification (torrefaction, slow to flash pyrolysis, and gasification) followed by activation (physical, chemical or physicochemical). Findings from several case studies demonstrate that lignocellulosic residues provide attractive precursors, and that chemical activation of the derived biochars at high temperature and long residence time produces highly porous end materials. Indeed, the porosity of activated biochars varies greatly (from 200 to 2500 m2 g−1), depending on the pyro-gasification operating conditions and the feedstock (different feedstocks have distinct morphological and chemical structures). The results also indicate that the development of highly porous activated biochars for diverse purposes (e.g., electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices, catalyst supports and adsorbents for water treatment) would benefit both the bioeconomy and the environment. Notably, it would leverage the potential of added-value biomass as an economical, non-fossil, readily available, and renewable energy source. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

The challenge is to define the gasification conditions that will provide a H2:CO:CO2 ratio suitable for syngas fermentation, as well as to identify and remove the compounds that can inhibit the performance of the microorganisms. The right balance between the gasification conditions and a line up with minimal gas cleaning needs to be assessed to improve the economic feasibility of the process. In this work a first attempt to combine the two processes is presented, with the aim to provide an insight of the indirect gasification, the gas cleaning applied, the effect of the main impurities and the performance of syngas fermentation. A lignin rich feedstock was gasified with steam in an indirect gasifier, at TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research). The gas, after removal of some components that could hinder the performance of the fermentation (tar compounds, BTX, unsaturated hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds), consisted of CO, H2, CO2, CH4, C2H6 and traces of other hydrocarbons. The influence of the obtained syngas quality and composition was evaluated in the fermentation process using Clostridium ljungdahlii, at KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). For comparison, product gas from beech wood gasification was also evaluated in the fermentation process under the same conditions.},

	abstract = {Recovery and utilization of municipal solid waste (MSW) into syngas has already attracted the attention of researchers for years. However, until now the MSW such as sewage sludge and plastics still lack a way of industrial utilization due to the relatively low transformation efficiency or low gas quality. Accordingly, a novel integrated pyrolysis-gasification technology is proposed in this study, in which the volatiles and steam released from the pyrolysis of sewage sludge at 450°C take part in the gasification of plastic at 600 °C-800°C, taking advantage of high-water content of sludge to produce high quality bio-gas. At the same time, the synergistic effect between sludge pyrolysis and plastic gasification was explored by product analysis. Compared to pyrolysis or gasification alone, the aromatic degree of the bio-oil obtained by the integrated technology under pyrolysis at 450°C and gasification at 700°C weakens. Whereas, the aromatic degree of the bio-oil obtained at 450°C (pyrolysis) and 800°C (gasification) deepens, and the yield of C2Hy in the bio-gas improves markedly. The higher temperature promotes the decomposition and condensation of macromolecules and also strengthens the influence of volatiles and steam from sludge pyrolysis on the structural fracture of plastics during gasification to some extent. In conclusion, this technology can significantly improve bio-gas yield and quality at high temperature.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the use of lignin-rich residues from second generation bioethanol production, to produce syngas that can be applied in the gas fermentation process. Three gasification technologies at a different scale were considered in this study. Fixed bed updraft gasification of about 30 kg/h solid feed, bubbling fluidized bed gasification of about 0.3 kg/h solid feed and indirect gasification of about 3 kg/h solid feed. Two lignin-rich residues with different properties were tested and the results were evaluated in terms of feedstock pretreatment (grinding, drying and pelleting) and syngas quality requirements for the fermentation process. The molar H2/CO ratio (ranging from 0.6 to 1.0) and the tar yield (18–108 g/Nm3) obtained from the three gasification technologies was quite different. For the syngas fermentation process, low H2 to CO ratio is preferred, as most of the organisms grow better on CO than H2. Furthermore, different contents of impurities that can reduce the fermentability of the gas (such as hydrocarbons, HCN, HCl, NH3, COS and other organic S- compounds) were detected in the product gas. The concentration of these compounds in the syngas is related to the content of the corresponding compounds in the original feedstock. The different characteristics of the lignin-rich feedstocks are related to the specific pre-treatment technologies for the (hemi)cellulose extraction. By tuning the pre-treatment technology, the properties of the feedstock can be improved, making it a suitable for gasification. Tar and unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds need to be removed to very low levels prior to the fermentation process. As a next step, the combination of the gasification and the appropriate product gas cleaning, with the syngas fermentation process for the production of bio-alcohols will be evaluated and the overall efficiency of the gasification-fermentation process will be assessed.},

	abstract = {Thermal processing of sewage sludge (SS) has received increasing attention in recent years. Thermal processes valorise the carbon rich organic fraction of SS, while effectively reducing SS volume. However, the fate and distribution of heavy metals (HMs) during thermal processing of SS is an important issue to address because it has impact on the generation of secondary pollutants and the environmental acceptability of the residues for reuse and reclamation. The refractory metals (thermally stable, i.e. Cr, Mn and Ni) are less volatile at typical temperature ranges (200–1100 °C) of thermal processes, and they are enriched in the residues. On the contrary, HMs with lower thermal stability (i.e. Hg, Cd, As and Pb) are prone to volatilisation. However, volatilisations and enrichments of HMs in the residues strongly depend on the characteristics of SS and nature of the thermal process. This review article discusses the volatilisation, enrichment and speciation (or stabilisation) of HMs in the residues formed during thermal processing of SS (incineration, pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal treatment). First, it summarises the fundamental aspect of SS in each thermal process. The influencing factors on the fate and distribution of HMs are discussed in terms of process principles, reactor types, operating conditions, pre-treatment of SS, use of additives and co-processing with secondary feedstocks. The use of advanced analytical techniques and modelling tools to analyse the complexity of HMs redistribution during thermal processing is described. Practical and economic challenges associated with HMs in SS during operation of full-scale thermal processing facilities are also addressed. Finally, a brief comparison of HMs redistribution and stabilisation during SS incineration, gasification, pyrolysis and hydrothermal treatment is provided.},

	abstract = {Global municipal waste production causes multiple environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, ocean plastic accumulation, and nitrogen pollution. However, estimates of both past and future development of waste and pollution are scarce. We apply compositional Bayesian regression to produce the first estimates of past and future (1965-2100) waste generation disaggregated by composition and treatment, along with resultant environmental impacts, for every country. We find that total wastes grow at declining speed with economic development, and that global waste generation has increased from 635 Mt in 1965 to 1999 Mt in 2015 and reaches 3539 Mt by 2050 (median values, middle-of-the-road scenario). From 2015 to 2050, the global share of organic waste declines from 47\% to 39\%, while all other waste type shares increase, especially paper. The share of waste treated in dumps declines from 28\% to 18\%, and more sustainable recycling, composting, and energy recovery treatments increase. Despite these increases, we estimate environmental loads to continue increasing in the future, although yearly plastic waste input into the oceans has reached a peak. Waste production does not appear to follow the environmental Kuznets curve, and current projections do not meet UN SDGs for waste reduction. Our study shows that a continuation of current trends and improvements is insufficient to reduce pressures on natural systems and achieve a circular economy. Relative to 2015, the amount of recycled waste would need to increase from 363 Mt to 740 Mt by 2030 to begin reducing unsustainable waste generation, compared to 519 Mt currently projected.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge is obtained from wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants. The sludge consists of two basic forms, sludge and secondary sludge, also known as activated sludge in the case of activated sludge process. Municipal sewage sludge (MSS) or only sewage can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid muddy residue. It contains mainly proteins, sugars, detergents, phenols, and lipids and also includes toxic and hazardous organic and inorganic pollutants source. Sewage is a mixture of domestic and industrial wastes that contains above 99\% water. It is produced by residential, institutional, commercial, and industrial establishments. Sludge is semi-solid slurry and can be produced as sewage sludge from wastewater treatment processes. The sludge consists of a wide range of harmful substances such as dioxins and furans, polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, absorbed and extracted chlorine derivatives, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols and their derivatives, phthalate, and others. Sewage treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater, primarily from household sewage. It includes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove these contaminants and produce environmentally safe treated wastewater. The treatment is divided into three stages: pretreatment, primary treatment, and secondary treatment. In pretreatment, large solids and grit are removed by screening. In primary treatment, the water is left to stand so that solids can sink to the bottom and oil and grease can rise to the surface. In secondary treatment, the sludge is further treated in sludge digesters.},

	abstract = {Sludge production and disposal are entering a period of dramatic change, driven mainly by EC legislation. The urban waste water treatment Directive will result in at least 50\% more sludge being produced by the end of 2005 and, during the next decade, sludge disposal to all the established outlets could become increasingly difficult or, in the case of sea disposal, will become illegal. The challenge facing the members of the European Union is how to (a) maintain cost‐effective and secure methods of sludge disposal and (b) engender public confidence in all disposal and recycling options. What is required is not so much innovative technology, although this may be essential, but more innovative attitudes and approaches to promotion and defending existing outlets. This paper describes the likely pattern of sludge production, treatment and disposal which will emerge during the implementation of recent EC directives and other national policies in Europe, and focuses on the areas and issues which require innovative approaches.

	abstract = {Summary: Population and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) projections are used to estimate total global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation over the twenty-first century. Some projections for global population suggest that it will peak this century. Waste generation rates per capita generally increase with affluence, although in the most affluent countries there is also a trend toward dematerialization. The confluence of these factors means that at some point in the future total global waste generation could possibly peak. To determine when peak waste might occur, we used the shared-socioeconomic pathway scenarios (used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] studies) combined with estimates of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rates, extrapolated from our work for the World Bank. Despite the expectation that total MSW generation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and high-income countries will peak mid-century, with current trajectories global peak waste is not expected before 2100. The peak could be moved forward to around 2075 and reduced in intensity by some 30\% if a more aggressive sustainability growth scenario were followed, rather than the current business-as-usual scenario. Further, the magnitude of peak waste is sensitive to the intensity of waste generation; it could vary from 7.3 to 10.9 megatonnes per day under the sustainability scenario. The timing of peak waste will substantially depend on the development of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, where population growth rates are more than double the rest of the world.},

Thermal pretreatment helps in the breakage of the lignin bonds and breaks down the crystalline structure of cellulose, leading to solubiliza-tion of COD, proteins, carbohydrates of OFMSW, higher biogas yield, and volatile solid removal during anaerobic digestion. This chapter concentrates on the temperature phase treatment and thermal pretreatment (conventional, microwave, and thermo-chemical), their principle, and their effect on process efficiency. Along with it, the merits, demerits of thermal pre/treatment, production of inhibitory compounds, and their effect on AD have been discussed. Furthermore, the commercial application, economic and environmental feasibility of thermal pretreatment of OFMSW has also been covered in this chapter.

This study presents an experimental approach to utilizing syngas as reburn fuel for NOx emissions reduction. In a 65 kWth furnace firing natural gas, the reburning characteristics for simulated syngas representing main syngas components, such as CH4, CO and H2, were evaluated for co-firing ratios up to 20\%. The heating value and gas residence time of the syngas were maintained in the reburn zone by adjusting the N2 concentration. Detailed distribution of temperature, O2 and NOx concentrations within the furnace were measured for the test conditions. The lower stoichiometric ratios of the primary combustion zone by reburning were favorable in reducing NOx formation from the main fuel. Among the syngas components, CH4 was most efficient, exhibiting an immediate decrease in NOx concentration after injection through the formation of HCN. CO and H2 also contributed to the reduction of NOx emissions by suppressing further formation of NOx in the reburn zone. The NOx removal efficiency was diminished by an increase in NOx concentrations in the burnout zone.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment for sewage sludge treatment was carried out by estimating the environmental and economic impacts of the six alternative scenarios most often used in Japan: dewatering, composting, drying, incineration, incinerated ash melting and dewatered sludge melting, each with or without digestion. Three end-of-life treatments were also studied: landfilling, agricultural application and building material application. The results demonstrate that sewage sludge digestion can reduce the environmental load and cost through reduced dry matter volume. The global warming potential (GWP) generated from incineration and melting processes can be significantly reduced through the reuse of waste heat for electricity and/or heat generation. Equipment production in scenarios except dewatering has an important effect on GWP, whereas the contribution of construction is negligible. In addition, the results show that the dewatering scenario has the highest impact on land use and cost, the drying scenario has the highest impact on GWP and acidification, and the incinerated ash melting scenario has the highest impact on human toxicity due to re-emissions of heavy metals from incinerated ash in the melting unit process. On the contrary, the dewatering, composting and incineration scenarios generate the lowest impact on human toxicity, land use and acidification, respectively, and the incinerated ash melting scenario has the lowest impact on GWP and cost. Heavy metals released from atmospheric effluents generated the highest human toxicity impact, with the effect of dioxin emissions being significantly lower. This study proved that the dewatered sludge melting scenario is an environmentally optimal and economically affordable method. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The quality of these wastes depends on their source, the way in which they are collected and the treatment they receive. The final fate of these wastes is also very diverse. To better understand these systems this chapter provides definitions and reuse typologies and describes common reuse patterns and their driving factors. The chapter also shows that, while the prospects for resource recovery from wastewater and sludge are promising the potential is still largely untapped, except in the informal sector. The resources embedded in the approximately 330 km 3 year of municipal wastewater that are globally generated would be theoretically enough to irrigate and fertilize millions of hectares of crops and to produce biogas to supply energy for millions of households. However, only a tiny proportion of these wastes is currently treated, and the portion which is safely reused is significantly smaller than the existing direct and especially indirect use of untreated wastewater, which are posing significant potential health risks. The chapter ends with a call for standardized data collection and reporting efforts across the formal and informal reuse sectors to provide more reliable and updated information on the wastewater and sludge cycles, essential to develop proper diagnosis and effective policies for the safe and productive use of these resources.},

	abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) demonstrates potential for COVID-19 community transmission monitoring; however, data on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater are needed to interpret WBE results. The decay rates of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and a potential surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), were investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in untreated wastewater, autoclaved wastewater, and dechlorinated tap water stored at 4, 15, 25, and 37 °C. Temperature, followed by matrix type, most greatly influenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA first-order decay rates (k). The average T90 (time required for 1-log10 reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA ranged from 8.04 to 27.8 days in untreated wastewater, 5.71 to 43.2 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 9.40 to 58.6 days in tap water. The average T90 for RNA of MHV at 4 to 37 °C ranged from 7.44 to 56.6 days in untreated wastewater, 5.58–43.1 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 10.9 to 43.9 days in tap water. There was no statistically significant difference between RNA decay of SARS-CoV-2 and MHV; thus, MHV is suggested as a suitable persistence surrogate. Decay rate constants for all temperatures were comparable across all matrices for both viral RNAs, except in untreated wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, which showed less sensitivity to elevated temperatures. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for WBE application.},

The aim was to simulate different fuel cell working conditions taking into consideration a reduced number of parameters. The reduced order model for an MCFC fed by syngas is formulated and implemented in Matlab. A validation process for experimental data of the MCFC was made for some fuel and oxidant mixtures and adequate results are shown. The maximum percentage error ranges between 3.7\% and 5.4\% in the various considered cases. At the anode, the direct internal water gas shift chemical reaction and the electrochemical consumption of carbon monoxide in addition to electrochemical consumption of hydrogen are considered. The ratio between the molar flows of carbon monoxide and hydrogen electrochemically consumed is a function of average rates of the electrochemical reactions and influences fuel cell performance. Furthermore, the simulation model is used to estimate the fuel cell performance varying the above-mentioned ratio. Acting on this ratio the performances of and MCFC fed by syngas and hydrogen could become comparable.},

	abstract = {To enhance global water use assessment, the WaterGAP3 model was improved for back-calculating domestic, manufacturing and thermoelectric water uses until 1950 for 177 countries. Model simulations were carried-out on a national scale to estimate water withdrawals and consumption as well as cooling water required for industrial processes and electricity production. Additionally, the amount of treated and untreated wastewater as generated by the domestic and manufacturing sectors was modeled. In the view of data availability, model simulations are based on key socio-economic driving forces and thermal electricity production. Technological change rates were derived from statistical records in order to consider developments in water use efficiency, which turned out to have a crucial role in water use dynamics. Simulated domestic and industrial water uses increased from ca. 300km3 in 1950 to 1345km3 in 2010, 12\% of which were consumed and 88\% of which were discharged back into freshwater bodies. The amount of domestic and manufacturing wastewater increased considerably over the last decade, but only half of it was untreated. The downscaling of the untreated wastewater volume to river basin scale indicates a matter of concern in East and Southeast Asia, Northern Africa, and Eastern and Southern Europe. In order to reach the Millennium Development Goals, securing water supply and the reduction of untreated wastewater discharges should be amongst the priority actions to be undertaken. Population growth and increased prosperity have led to increasing water demands. However, societal and political transformation processes as well as policy regulations resulting in new water-saving technologies and improvements counteract this development by slowing down and even reducing global domestic and industrial water uses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Irrigation with wastewater supports agricultural production and the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers in many parts of the world. Considering the importance of better wastewater management at the local and national levels, there is a need for updated national data on wastewater generation, treatment, and use, which would also assist in regional and global wastewater assessments. While searching data and literature in published or electronic forms for 181 countries, we find that only 55 countries have data available on all three aspects of wastewater - generation, treatment, and use. The number of countries with one or two aspects of wastewater generation, treatment, and use is 69, while there is no information available from 57 countries. Of the available information, only 37\% of the data could be categorized as recent (reported during 2008-2012). The available data suggest that high-income countries on average treat 70\% of the generated wastewater, followed by upper-middle-income countries (38\%), lower-middle-income countries (28\%), and low-income countries, where only 8\% of the wastewater generated is treated. The availability of current information on wastewater generation, treatment, and use is crucially important for policy makers, researchers, and practitioners, as well as public institutions, to develop national and local action plans aiming at safe and productive use of wastewater in agriculture, aquaculture, and agroforestry systems. The country level information aggregated at the regional and global levels would help in identifying the gaps in pertinent data availability and assessing the potential of wastewater in food, feed, and fish production at different scales. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The use of detailed fluid and biological reaction models and advanced instrumentation and control systems is studied to optimize treatment performances.

	abstract = {Chemical recycling is considered an attractive technological pathway for reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as promoting circular economy. In the EU, readiness to develop a full commercial plant is becoming increasingly important given the ambitious goal to recycle all plastics by 2030. Household packaging streams tend to be of lower quality and lower recycling performance compared to industrial and commercial waste streams, thus requiring particular attention. This paper assesses chemical recycling technologies available and identifies the most suitable for recycling of household plastic waste. We identify eight different technologies and compare them in terms of process temperature, sensitivity to feedstock contamination and level of polymer breakdown, three critical factors affecting the cost and attractiveness of a chemical process. In addition, we carry out a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment for eight technologies based on the stage of their present development. The review is based on peer-reviewed scientific papers and information collected from technology developers and providers, as well as interviews with experts. Our analysis outlines advantages and disadvantages of technologies available for chemical plastic recycling and their TRL. The chemical recycling technologies with the highest TRL are pyrolysis, catalytic cracking and conventional gasification. However, the economic feasibility of these technologies is difficult to assess due to the low number of projects in operation and scarcity of data available for comparison. The results of this analysis provide timely information as policy makers and developers set targets for recycling, and contemplate investments on research and chemical plastic recovering plants.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤.05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process. © The Author(s) 2011.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The aim of the paper was to summarize and discuss current research trends in biomass thermal treatment (torrefaction process). Quantitative analyses were carried out, in which the main countries, research units and scientists were indicated. The analysis showed a clear upward trend in number of publications after 2010. Most scientists on selected topics come from China, USA, Canada, South Korea, Republic of China, Poland (Web od Science—Core Collection (WoS-CC) and Scopus databases). Quantitative analysis also showed that the most relevant WoS-CC categories in the summary are: Energy Fuels, Engineering Chemical, Agricultural Engineering, Biotechnology Applied Microbiology and Thermodynamics and Scopus Subject area: Energy, Chemical Engineering, Environmental Science, Engineering and Chemistry. Thematic analysis included research topics, process parameters and raw materials used. Thematic groups were separated: torrefaction process (temp.: 150–400 °C), hydrothermal carbonization process (HTC) (temp: 120–500 °C), pyrolysis process (temp.: 200–650 °C) and gasification and co-combustion process (temp.: 350–1600 °C). In the years 2015–2019, current research topics were: new torrefaction technologies (e.g., HTC), improvement of the physico-mechanical, chemical and energetic properties of produced fuel as well as the use of torrefied biomass in the process of pyrolysis, gasification and co-combustion. The raw materials used in all types of biomass thermal treatment were: energy crops, wood from fast-growing and exotic trees, waste from the agri-food industry, sewage sludge and microalgae.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The conversion of biogenic residues to fuels and chemicals via gasification and synthesis processes is a promising pathway to replace fossil carbon. In this study, the focus is set on sewage sludge gasification for syngas production. Experiments were carried out in a 20 kW fuel input bubbling fluidized bed facility with steam and oxygen as gasification agent. In-situ produced sewage sludge ash was used as bed material. The sensitivity of the key operation parameters gasifier temperature, oxygen ratio, steam to carbon ratio, and the space velocity on the syngas composition (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, CxHy, H2S, COS, NH3, and tars) was determined. The results show that the produced syngas has high H2 and CO concentrations of up to 0.37 m3 m−3 and 0.18 m3 m−3, respectively, and is thus suitable for synthesis of fuels and chemicals. By adjusting the steam to carbon ratio, the syngas’ H2 to CO ratio can be purposely tailored by the water gas shift reaction for various synthesis products, e.g., synthetic natural gas (H2/CO = 3) or Fischer–Tropsch products (H2/CO = 2). Also, the composition and yields of fly ash and bed ash are presented. Through the gasification process, the cadmium and mercury contents of the bed ash were drastically reduced. The ash is suitable as secondary raw material for phosphorous or phosphate fertilizer production. Overall, a broad database was generated that can be used for process simulation and process design.},

Rice straw significantly affects the release of volatile matter in the co-pyrolysis. It inhibits in the begining period, and promotes in the middle and later periods. With the increase of rice straw's amount, the temperature range of the volatile matter' release reduces, volatile matter release acceleratedly , both the speed and rate of weight loss increase. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that parameters in the stage of volatile matter liberation, which can be well linear fitted, have kinetic compensation effect in the process of co-pyrolysis.},

	abstract = {In the present study, the co-pyrolysis of mahua seeds (MS) and waste thermocol (WTC) (1:1) blends was performed at 450–600 °C. The obtained co-pyrolysis oil (CPO) was characterized for physicochemical properties and its suitability as an alternative fuel. The performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of six different CPO diesel (CPOD) blends (B10, B20, B30, B40, B50, and B60) were also assessed at various engine loads. The experimental results indicated a maximum pyrolysis oil yield of 99.6\% for waste thermocol pyrolytic oil (WTCPO) and 74.2\% for CPO at 525 °C. The physicochemical characterization specified that CPO has a specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, and calorific value of 0.91 mL g−1, 1.94 cSt, and 40.6 MJ kg−1, respectively with a carbon chain length of C7–C24. The brake thermal efficiency (30.9 to 27.1\%) and NO emission decreased with an increase in CPO percentage in the blends. The maximum heat release rate of CPOD blends increased with an increase in the percentage of CPO in diesel. The estimated mean value of activation energy (Ea), pre-exponential factors, enthalpy (ΔH), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for MS, WTC, and MS:WTC (1:1) blend were 135.1, 186.3, and 171.4 kJ mol−1; 18.1, 25.6, and 24.4 min−1; 130.6, 180.5, and 165.6 kJ mol−1; and 188.5, 301.1, and 206.3 kJ mol−1, respectively. The reaction function for the thermal degradation of MS and WTC was expressed as f(x) = (1– x)2.9, and f(x) = (1 – x)0.93 (0.017 + x 0.35) using multivariate nonlinear regression. The present research provides comprehensive data in understanding the engine performance characteristics, thermal behavior of biomass, and waste plastics that coexist in municipal solid waste.},

A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water. Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water. In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments. Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids. Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution. HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods. The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140444},
	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been found in the faeces of infected patients in numerous studies. Stool may remain positive for SARS-CoV-2, even when the respiratory tract becomes negative, and the interaction with the gastrointestinal tract poses a series of questions about wastewater and its treatments. This review aims to understand the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and sewage and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The viral load in the faeces of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at between 5·103 to 107.6 copies/mL, depending on the infection course. In the sewerage, faeces undergo dilution and viral load decreases considerably in the wastewater entering a WWTP with a range from 2 copies/100 mL to 3·103 copies/mL, depending on the level of the epidemic. Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, although no evidence of COVID-19 transmission has been found via this route, could be advantageously exploited as an early warning of outbreaks. Preliminary studies on WBE seem promising; but high uncertainty of viral loads in wastewater and faeces remains, and further research is needed. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, based on RNA sequences and RT-PCR, requires a shared approach on sample pre-treatment and on-site collection to ensure comparable results. The finding of viral RNA in stools does not imply that the virus is viable and infectious. Viability of CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2 decreases in wastewater - due to temperature, pH, solids, micropollutants - but high inactivation in WWTPs can be obtained only by using disinfection (free chlorine, UVC light). A reduction in the quantity of disinfectants can be obtained by implementing Membrane-Bioreactors with ultrafiltration to separate SARS-CoV-2 virions with a size of 60–140 nm. In sludge treatment, thermophilic digestion is effective, based on the general consensus that CoVs are highly sensitive to increased temperatures.},

	abstract = {The last 17 years have seen three major outbreaks caused by coronaviruses, with the latest outbreak, COVID-19, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The frequency of these outbreaks, their mortality and associated disruption to normal life calls for concerted efforts to understand their occurrence and fate in different environments. There is an increased interest in the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater from the perspective of wastewater-based epidemiology. However, there is no comprehensive review of the knowledge on coronavirus occurrence, fate and potential transmission in wastewater. This paper, provides a review of the literature on the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater treatment processes. We discuss the presence of viral RNA in feces as a result of diarrhoea caused by gastrointestinal infections. We also reviewed the literature on the presence, survival and potential removal of coronaviruses in common wastewater treatment processes. The detection of infectious viral particles in feces of patients raises questions on the potential risks of infection for people exposed to untreated sewage/wastewater. We, therefore, highlighted the potential risk of infection with coronaviruses for workers in wastewater treatment plants and the public that may be exposed through faulty plumbing or burst sewer networks. The mortalities and morbidities associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic warrants a much more focused research on the role of environments, such as wastewater and surface water, in disease transmission. The current wealth of knowledge on coronaviruses in wastewater based on the reviewed literature is scant and therefore calls for further studies.},

Anaerobic digestion of agro-waste is one of the ways to tackle this problem but hindered by the recalcitrant nature of agro-waste. This study investigated the effect of granular activated carbon (GAC) and granular biochar (GBC) addition to enhance the thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion of wheat husk and sewage sludge. The conductive materials (particle size: 2–5 mm) were added separately at five different concentrations: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 g/ Linoculum. The findings revealed that samples amended with GAC and GBC at 20 g/L dosage had the highest biogas yield of 263 and 273 mL/gVSadded, respectively, corresponding to 22 and 27\% higher yield than the control. Additionally, a shorter lag phase was observed in both cases compared to the Control. However, the GBC amended samples showed relatively stable biogas production compared to GAC and consistent results regarding pH, alkalinity, total volatile fatty acids, and soluble chemical oxygen demand. The pre- liminary techno-economic analysis indicates that addition of GAC or GBC may not be feasible and require other innovative engineered solutions for the addition of conductive materials. This study confirms that GAC and GBC amendments enhance the biogas productivity and process stability in anaerobic digestion of recalcitrant agro-waste under the high-temperature regime and calls for further research in this direction},

In this paper, the BMP tests of five different vegetable (snap bean, capsicum, cucumber, eggplant, and tomato) crop residues were conducted at feed to inoculum ratio (F/I) of 2.0 under mesophilic (36 ± 1 °C) conditions. A series of single-variable and multiple-variable regression models were built based on organic components (hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, total fat, total sugar, and crude protein) for BMP prediction. Three kinetic models, including the first-order kinetic model, the Chen and Hashimoto model, and the modified Gompertz model, were used to simulate the methane yield results of VCR and obtain valuable model parameters simultaneously. As a result, the BMPs and volatile solids (VS) degradation degree of different VCRs were respectively in the range of 94.2–146.8 mL g−1 VS and 40.4–49.9\%; the regression prediction models with variables lignin (R2 = 0.704, p = 0.076), variables crude protein and lignin (R2 = 0.976, p = 0.048), and variables total fat, hemicellulose, and lignin (R2 = 0.999, p = 0.027) showed the best performance on BMP prediction among the single-factor, two-factor, and three-factor models, respectively. In addition, compared to the other two kinetic models, the modified Gompertz model could be excellently fitted (R2 = 0.986–0.998) to the results of BMP experiment, verification deviations within 0.3\%.},

	abstract = {The present work summarizes the major research findings related to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) study of COVID-19 and puts forward a conceptual framework, termed as "Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP)" for implementation of WBE. SWEEP framework is likely to tackle few practical issues related to WBE and simultaneously proposes refinements to the approach for better outcome and efficiency to save precious lives around the globe. It is observed that the present pandemic offers an opportunity for SWEEP to get included in routine urban water management to put the humankind at front to stop such pandemic in future or at least be prepared to fight against it. With global collaboration, SWEEP can be fine-tuned to meet diverse needs, making the present and future generations resilient to future viral outbreaks. Recent WBE studies conducted to check for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater revealed that raw sewage samples tested positive to PCR-based assays while the treated samples showed absence of viral titers. Moreover, the lockdown had a positive impact on decreasing the viral loading in sewage. The proposed SWEEP protocol has an advantage over testifying individuals for predicting the stage of pandemic.},

While infectious SARS-CoV-2 has not previously been identified in wastewater, infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from the feces of at least one patient, raising concerns about the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The fate and inactivation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in water and waste-water are unknown, with current inactivation estimates based on surrogate models. In this study, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and RNA signal was determined in water and wastewater. The times for 90\% reduction (T 90) of viable SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and tap water at room temperature were 1.5 and 1.7 days, respectively. In high-starting titer (10 5 TCID 50 mL −1) experiments, infectious virus persisted for the entire 7-day sampling time course. In wastewater at 50 and 70 °C, the observed T 90 values for infectious SARS-CoV-2 were decreased to 15 and 2 min, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found to be significantly more persistent than infectious SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the environmental detection of RNA alone does not substantiate risk of infection.},

	abstract = {The elevated conditions needed for hydrothermal carbonization of biomass require a special high-pressure reactor which makes it expensive and time-consuming. The soft computing approaches as proposed here can predict the conversion of any feedstock based on the composition and operating conditions without the need for any kinetic modeling. In this study, Extreme Gradient Boosting method (XGBoost), Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLPANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained in python programming language using the data available from the literature for hydrothermal carbonization of different biomass. Statistically, XGBoost showed a higher accuracy among all studied approaches with R 2 of 0.999 and 0.964 for training and testing data, respectively. The conversion was sensitive to temperature, time, lignin, moisture content, cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, for the range of conditions applied. It was also revealed that none of the parameters were negligible, however operating conditions were more influential followed by lignin content. This proposed approach can be extended to include lique-faction and gasification processes, where the distribution of products can be estimated for any lignocellulosic biomass. ARTICLE HISTORY},

Three compositions were prepared by the solution combustion method: (La,Sm,Dy,Er,RE)2O3, where all oxides are in equimolar ratios and RE is Nd or Gd or Y. After annealing at 800 °C, all powders contained mainly a phase of C-type bixbyite structure. After laser melting, all samples were quenched in a single-phase monoclinic B-type structure. Thermal analysis indicated three reversible phase transitions in the range 1900–2400 °C, assigned as transformations into A, H, and X rare earth sesquioxides structure types. Unit cell volumes and volume changes on C-B, B-A, and H-X transformations were measured by X-ray diffraction and consistent with the trend in pure rare earth sesquioxides. The formation of single-phase solid solutions was predicted by Calphad calculations. The melting point was determined for the (La,Sm,Dy,Er,Nd)2O3 sample as 2456 ± 12 °C, which is higher than for any of constituent oxides. An increase in melting temperature is probably related to nonideal mixing in the solid and/or the melt and prompts future investigation of the liquidus surface in Sm2O3-Dy2O3, Sm2O3-Er2O3, and Dy2O3-Er2O3 systems.},

A constant heat flux was imposed on the upper surface of the sample while the temperature was measured on the opposite insulated surface.

The squared difference objective function of the numerical and experimental temperatures was defined considering the error generated by the contact resistance. The temperature was numerically calculated by using the finite difference method. In addition, the reliability of the results was assured by an uncertainty analysis.

L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and lysine (K) peptide mimics of mussel adhesive proteins strongly interact with surfaces and may be useful for surface attachment of lubricating polymers in tribosystems. Here, we describe a significant improvement in lubrication properties of poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces when modified with PEG-DOPA-K. Surfaces were characterized by optical and atomic force microscopy, contact angle, PM-IRRAS, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Such surfaces, tested over the course of 200 rotations ( approximately 8 m in length), maintained an extremely low friction coefficient (mu) (0.03 +/- 0.00) compared to bare PDMS (0.98 +/- 0.02). These results indicate the potential applications of PEG-DOPA-K for the modification of device surfaces. Extremely low mu values were maintained over relatively long length scales and a range of sliding speeds without the need for substrate pre-activation and in the absence of excess polymer in aqueous solution. These results were only obtained when DOPA was bound to lysine (modification with PEG-DOPA did not have an effect on mu) suggesting the critical role of lysine in obtaining a lowered friction coefficient.},

	abstract = {This article presents the most popular methods of sewage sludge management and associated unit operations and processes referring to them. The most popular methods are: Reclamation and adaptation of lands to specific needs; plant cultivation not intended for consumption or for production of food; usage in agriculture; usage in building; recovery of phosphorus, rare earth metals or fats and usage in industry; producing combustible pellets, granulates or other usable materials such as absorbents; and storage on territory of treatment plant and landfills. Processing connected with stabilization leads to generation of materials which might be contaminated with variety of organic compounds. Since this type of management generally assumes introduction of processed sludge to the ground, it can cause soil contamination with unknown compounds of organic origin. However, thermal processing of raw sewage sludge essentially excludes such possibility. Majority of organic matter is transformed into simple, mineralized form. In this case the most problematic issue is sewage sludge ash contamination with heavy metals. Although, determination of heavy metals in ashes is much simpler than determination of organic compounds. Chemical analysis can be very useful to asses environmental safety of processed and managed sewage sludge. That is why there is a significant quantity of used analytical techniques which are likely to support the processes of designing and implementing new economically and environmentally reasonable ways of re-using sewage sludge. Further, the process of technological utilization of sewage sludge conducted in Wastewater Treatment Plant "Wschód" in Gdańsk is described. Recently technological line was upgraded. Now excessive sewage sludge is anaerobic digested with biogas recovery. Fermentation residues are incinerated in fluidized bed furnace. Ashes are cemented and land filled. Gdańska Infrastruktura Wodociągowo-Kanalizacyjna, which is owner of the treatment plant "Wschód" is planning development strategy for the implementation of a pro-ecological management method connected with production of light construction materials and phosphorus recovery. Management of thermal treated sewage sludge is simpler and cheaper than non-thermal management, especially in case of large amounts of treated sewage sludge like in Wastewater Treatment Plant "Wschód". Management in smaller installations of treatment plants collecting sewage sludge from less industrialized agglomerations is also less complicated. Sewage sludge management process should be developed separately for each treatment plant. Only then all management methods will be ecologically and economically justified.},

	abstract = {Transition and decarbonization of the energy sector require the utilisation of new technologies and energy sources. Higher penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources implies the installation of energy storage, to store electricity excess and enhanced system efficiency. These electricity surpluses that will occur more often in the future energy system could be effectively utilized for the production of alternative fuels. Most of the alternative fuels that are considered for future applications are already known chemicals or products, nowadays used for other purposes. Another great advantage of some alternative fuels lies in their possibilities to act as an energy carrier. This feature might be crucial while discussing their utilisation potential and further development. Fuels which can simultaneously be used for power generation and as an energy carrier will have a more important role in the future and are likely to be utilized on a greater scale. Renewable energy source like biomass, on the other hand, is already widely used, and their role in the future system is not questionable. Even though significant increment in biomass consumption raises serious concerns about its sustainability, and seeks for new approaches. In this work, the authors tried to review alternative fuel characteristics, alongside their utilisation and production opportunities. To come up with the optimal solutions, the authors compared various proposed alternative fuels, alongside their advantages and drawbacks with an aim to find the most appropriate role for each fuel.},

This paper endows a comprehensive review about the recent advances of biochar material in synthesis, modulation, fundamental understanding and multifunctional performance. Understanding the role of biochar-based adsorbent and electrode in respective field of environmental remediation and electrochemical devices has been correlated. Typically, three kinds of biochar were classified, such as the pure biochar with different morphologies (spherical-, tubular-and nano-biochar), gra-phitized biochar, chemically functionalized biochar. Meanwhile, the advantages and disadvantages between biochar and other carbon-based materials is contrastively illustrated. It is emphasized that biochar material owns irreplaceable superiority in the widely low-cost raw biomass, the simple and low-energy consumption in manufacture , the porous structure and flexible chemistry adjustment, and the environment friendly and sustainability in natural surroundings. Challenges and perspectives are proposed about how to develop a promising design and manufacture of biochar species for multifunctional applications.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus ore extraction for soil fertilization supports the demand of modern agriculture, but extractable resource limitations, due to scarcity, impose a P reuse and recycling research agenda. Here we propose to integrate biochar production (pyrogenic carbon) with municipal and agricultural waste management systems, to recover and reuse phosphorous that would otherwise be lost from the ecological food web. A meta-analysis and available data on total P in biochar indicated that P-enriched feedstocks include animal manure, human excreta, and plant-biomass collected from P-polluted sites. Phosphorus in biochar could participate in P equilibriums in soils and is expected to supply P. The release, sorption and desorption of P by biochar will codetermine the potential of P replenishment by biochar and P loss from biochar-amended soils. Abiotic and biotic factors are expected to affect sorption/desorption of P between biochar and soil aggregates, and P acquisition by plants. Chemical extraction, using acid or alkaline solutions, is considered as a means for P retrieval from high P biochar, especially for biochar with high heavy metal contents. To bridge the gap between academia and practice, this paper proposes future development for phosphorus acclamation by pyrolysis: 1) identification of high-P bio-waste for pyrolysis; 2) retrieval of P by using biochar as soil amendment or by chemical leaching; 3) biochar modification by inorganic nutrients, P solubilizing microorganisms and other organic matter; and 4) compatible pyrolysis equipment fit to the current waste management context, such as households, and waste water treatment plants.},

This work first advanced a novel calcium oxide (CaO)-enhancement phosphorus-recycling technique based on pyrolysis of sewage sludge, by regulating the transformation of phosphorus in sewage sludge during pyrolysis through the CaO addition. The obtained results indicated that CaO addition promoted the formation of hydroxylapatite, which is a desirable phosphorus species for plant growth. The factors of pyrolysis temperature and inherent composition of sewage sludge both influenced the fraction of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis. An increase in pyrolysis temperature and a sludge with a high content of ash and a low content of volatile matters potentially promoted the transformation of P from organic phosphorus to the inorganic species during pyrolysis with the addition of CaO, particularly for the formation of hydroxylapatite. Increasing CaO addition significantly increased the fraction of hydroxylapatite in the obtained char, and the maximum content of 25 wt \% hydroxylapatite over total phosphorus was attained. This enhanced transformation of hydroxylapatite may be potentially attributed to the interaction between CaO and the polyphosphate with the aid of the inherent minerals that appeared to benefit the immobilization of phosphorus during sludge pyrolysis. As the formation of hydroxylapatite was enhanced, this facile technology of CaO-enhancement sewage sludge pyrolysis could be used for the direct recycling of P as well as the disposal of sewage sludge.},

A process for post oxidation of gasification ash and pyrolysis char was developed and the oxidized materials were investigated as well. Sequential extraction with full elemental balances of the extracted pools as well as scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to investigate the mechanisms driving the observed differences in composition and P plant availability in a short-term soil incubation study. The compositional changes related mainly to differences in the proximate composition as well as to the release of especially nitrogen, sulfur, cadmium and to some extent, phosphorus (P). The cadmium load per unit of P was reduced with 75–85\% in gasification processes and 10–15\% in pyrolysis whereas no reduction was observed in incineration processes. The influence on other heavy metals was less pronounced. The plant availability of P in the substrates varied from almost zero to almost 100\% of the plant availability of P in the untreated sludge. Post-oxidized slow pyrolysis char was found to be the substrate with the highest P fertilizer value while ash from commercial fluid bed sludge incineration had the lowest P fertilizer quality. The high P fertilizer value in the best substrate is suggested to be a function of several different mechanisms including structural surface changes and improvements in the association of P to especially magnesium, calcium and aluminum.},

There is an increasing effort to recover phosphorus from production waste streams. Sewage sludge presents an important source of phosphorus but also contains organic pollutants and heavy metals. Thermal treatment technologies seem to be a promising option to treat sewage sludge and obtain ash/char from which high recovery rate of phosphorus can be reached. In this review, sewage sludge management options in compliance with EU legal requirements are first reviewed. Follows, an overview of sewage sludge thermal treatment technologies including incineration, hydrothermal carbonisation, pyrolysis and gasification, for the purpose of phosphorus recapture. We summarize recent advances in thermal treatment processes of sewage sludge and phosphorus recovery, identify challenges and knowledge gaps. Thermochemical methods proved to have many advantages over pure wet chemical methods for phosphorus recovery. The review provides the foundation for future research aimed at achieving efficient, economic and environmental sustainable recapture of phosphorus from sludge thermal treatment products.

	abstract = {The pyrolyzation of sewage sludge (SS) could efficiently transform inherent phosphorus (P) into bioavailable phosphate forms, which endows SS-derived biochar (SSB) the potential as a soil fertilizer. However, the details about the release behavior of P in SSB have not been systematically investigated. This study evaluated the fast and slow P releasing behaviors from SSB and CaO-amended SSB prepared under different pyrolysis temperature. The higher pyrolysis temperature and CaO addition could enhance the conversion of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) into more bioavailable apatite inorganic phosphorous (AP). Acidic and alkaline conditions were favorable for the fast release of P from SSB. Higher ionic strength condition gave greater releasing amounts of TP and the SO42- facilitating a rapid release of TP than those for Cl- and NO3-. SSBs with CaO addition showed a much slower TP release than those without CaO both in fast release (24 h, with CaO: 0.05{\textasciitilde}0.4 mg TP g-1 SSB, e.g., without CaO 0.5{\textasciitilde}5 mg TP g-1 SSB) and slow release tests (21 days, with CaO: 1.2{\textasciitilde}4.1 mg TP g-1 SSB, e.g., without CaO 1.8{\textasciitilde}5.7 mg TP g-1 SSB). Ortho-P release was more remarkable for the SSB amended with CaO ({\textasciitilde}54\% of TP), which was likely due to the formation of orthophosphate. The results of this study suggested that SSB prepared by high pyrolysis temperature and CaO addition had high potential as a slow P-releasing fertilizer for the soil.},

This study aimed to assess, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), whether recovering dissipated P by producing sludge-based phosphate fertilizer can be a suitable method to reduce P depletion. Environmental impacts of four scenarios of production of sludge-based phosphate fertilizers were compared to those of production of triple super phosphate, a mineral phosphate fertilizer used as a reference scenario. The novelty of this study was to estimate environmental impacts of sludge-based phosphate fertilizer production using a “product” LCA perspective instead of a “waste” LCA perspective. Consequently, upstream production of sludge was considered by allocating part of the environmental burdens of wastewater treatment to sludge production. Life Cycle Impact Assessment was performed using the CML-IA characterization method. Results indicated that sludge-based phosphate fertilizers appeared less environmentally friendly than mineral phosphate fertilizers, due to the contribution of the upstream burden of sludge production and P recovery. Finally, although P recovery helps preserve the mineral P resource, the overall assessment remains unfavorable for sludge-based products due to the low yields of P recovery, low P concentration of the sludge and the large amounts of energy and reactants needed to recover the P.},

Subsequently, Fe and Al ions in the leachate of completely re-dissolution of Fe–P and Al–P in 2 N HCl were absorbed by CER to obtain a purified P solution.

	abstract = {Over the past years, numerous technologies have been developed to recover phosphorus (P) from waste streams to repair currently broken nutrient cycles. These developments were largely triggered by environmental considerations (sustainability, resource efficiency), concerns regarding the finite and geopolitically concentrated deposits of raw phosphate ore, and phosphate price increases. Municipal wastewater is a promising and viable source to recover P in larger quantities, to re-establish a circular economy and therefore increase net use efficiency. This work compiles the latest knowledge on approaches to recover P from municipal wastewater and related waste flows with a specific focus on the existing well-developed wastewater management infrastructure, available in significant parts of Europe (e.g., secondary treated effluent, digester supernatant, sewage sludge, sewage sludge ash). About 50 technologies were identified at various levels of development (industrial-, full-, pilot- and laboratory scale). The current selection of P recovery processes is broad and ranges from simple precipitation of dissolved P to complex multi-step approaches, and only a few of these displayed potential for full-scale implementation. They are discussed with regard to their technical principles, process parameters, recovery efficiency, resource demand, possible effects on wastewater treatment, waste flows, and fate of pollutants. We also evaluated them with respect to their rates of P removal from wastewater and their access points of P recovery. For selected technologies, material flow models are presented to facilitate the understanding of even complex processes. This work serves as a basis for future integrated comparative assessments of selected recovery approaches according to technical, environmental and economic criteria.},

	abstract = {Ashes from sewage sludge incineration are rich in phosphorus content, ranging between 4\% and 9\%. Due to the current methods of disposal used for these ashes, phosphorus, which is a valuable plant nutrient, is removed from biological cycling. This article proposes the possible three-stage processing of SSA, whereby more than 90\% of phosphorus can be extracted to make an adequate phosphate fertilizer. SSA from two Swiss sewage sludge incinerators was used for laboratory investigations. In an initial step, SSA was leached with sulfuric acid using a liquid-to-solid ratio of 2. The leaching time and pH required for high phosphorus dissolution were determined. Inevitably, dissolution of heavy metals takes place that would contaminate the fertilizer. Thus in a second step, leach solution has to be purified by having the heavy metals removed. Both ion exchange using chelating resins and sulfide precipitation turned out to be suitable for removing critical Cu, Ni and Cd. Thirdly, phosphates were precipitated as calcium phosphates with lime water. The resulting phosphate sludge was dewatered, dried and ground to get a powdery fertilizer whose efficacy was demonstrated by plant tests in a greenhouse. By measuring the weight of plants after 6 weeks of growth, fertilized in part with conventional phosphate fertilizer, fertilizer made from SSA was proven to be equal in its plant uptake efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Product filtrate was purified by passing through a cation exchange column, concentrated to 80\% H3PO4 and compared with technical grade H3PO4 specifications. The economics of phosphate recovery by this method are briefly discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In recent years, excessive amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the environment have seriously affected the environment and human health. Due to its high removal efficiency, high flexibility and good economic and environmental benefits, biochar (BC) is a stable carbon-rich product formed by thermal decomposition of biomass such as agricultural and forestry wastes under anoxic conditions. The fine pore structure of the original material has strong adsorption capacity, low solubility, stable physical and chemical properties, rich pore structure, and large specific surface area. BC can be made from any organic material, common raw materials are rice husk, straw, animal manure, sewage sludge and some other agricultural wastes. It has received widespread attention as an adsorbent that efficiently adsorbs and removes N and P. It can not only be used to control environmental pollution, but also has a good application prospect in soil improvement and engineering treatment. If it is widely used in engineering, its expected effect will be beneficial to the overall environment. At present, the number of review articles in this area is relatively small. In order for scholars to understand the research progress in this area more conveniently and quickly, through a lot of literature review and summary, this article summarizes the research status of BC on N and P adsorption, and elaborates. The influence factors and adsorption mechanism of N and P were introduced, the application of N and P adsorbed by BC as fertilizer in soil was introduced, the application of BC in engineering treatment was introduced, and the economic and environmental benefits of BC were analyzed. After summarizing the current findings, we explore the future development of BC's adsorption of N and P and issues that need to be considered in the future development process. It is expected that this systematic review will help other interested researchers to participate in further exploration of this research area.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for all living organisms and cannot be replaced. Municipal sewage sludge is a carrier of phosphorus, but also contains organic pollutants and heavy metals. A two-step thermal treatment is suggested, including mono-incineration of sewage sludge and subsequent thermochemical treatment of the ashes. Organic pollutants are completely destroyed by mono-incineration. The resulting sewage sludge ashes contain P, but also heavy metals. P in the ashes exhibits low bioavailability, a disadvantage in farming. Therefore, in a second thermochemical step, P is transferred into mineral phases available for plants, and heavy metals are removed as well. The thermochemical treatment was investigated in a laboratory-scale rotary furnace by treating seven different sewage sludge ashes under systematic variation of operational parameters. Heavy metal removal and the increase of the P-bioavailability were the focus of the investigation. The present experimental study shows that these objectives have been achieved with the proposed process. The P-bioavailability was significantly increased due to the formation of new mineral phases such as chlorapatite, farringtonite and stanfieldite during thermochemical treatment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Effective control of eutrophication is generally established through the reduction of nutrient loading into waterways and water bodies. An economically viable and ecologically sustainable approach to nutrient pollution control could involve the integration of retention ponds, wetlands and greenways into water management systems. Plants not only play an invaluable role in the assimilation and removal of nutrients, but they also support fauna richness and can be aesthetically pleasing. Pandanus amaryllifolius, a tropical terrestrial plant, was found to establish well in hydrophytic conditions and was highly effective in remediating high nutrient levels in an aquatic environment showing 100\% removal of NO-3-N up to 200 mg/L in 14 days. Phosphate uptake by the plant was less efficient with 64\% of the PO-4-P removed at the maximum concentration of 100 mg/L at the end of 6 weeks. With its high NO-3-N and PO3-4-P removal efficiency, P. amaryllifolius depleted the nutrient-rich media and markedly contained the natural colonization of algae. The impediment of algal growth led to improvements in the water quality with significant decreases in turbidity, pH and electrical conductivity. In addition, the plants did not show stress symptoms when grown in high nutrient levels as shown by the changes in their biomass, total soluble proteins and chlorophyll accumulation as well as photochemical efficiency. Thus, P. amaryllifolius is a potential candidate for the mitigation of nutrient pollution in phytoremediation systems in the tropics as the plant requires low maintenance, is tolerant to the natural variability of weather conditions and fluctuating hydro-periods, and exhibit good nutrient removal capabilities. © 2014 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) recovery from incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) has attracted increasing attentions in recent years. In this study, the P recovery was comparatively investigated on two types of ISSA for sewage sludge pretreated by Fenton's reagent, and a composite conditioner of Fenton's reagent and lime (referred to as ISSA-F and ISSA-FL, respectively). ISSA derived from raw sludge (referred to as ISSA-RS) was studied as the control group. The P species results showed that the proportions of AP (Ca-bound P) and NAIP (Al/Fe-bound P) in the ISSA samples were significantly affected by the added Fe and Ca elements in the sludge conditioner. The order of leaching efficiency of P in different ISSA samples was ISSA-F (100\%) {\textgreater} ISSA-RS (94.4\%) {\textgreater} ISSA-FL (83.1\%), which was significantly related to the Ca content in those ISSA samples. Higher Ca content in the ISSA-RS and ISS-FL samples induced calcium oxalate precipitation during leaching process, which hindered the release of P from ISSA. P recovery product mainly composed of aluminum hydroxyphosphate was prepared from the purified solutions leached from different ISSA samples. Moreover, acid-leaching residues of different ISSA samples after P recovery were proposed to be reutilized as cement mortar additives by replacing 15 wt\% of cement. The mechanical strength of the test cement mortar specimens with acid-leaching residues was comparable to that of the control cement mortar specimen without residue.},

	abstract = {Producing sewage sludge biochar followed by applying it as a P fertilizer is considered to be a competitive way to recover and reuse P resources. To apply sewage sludge biochar as a P fertilizer, it is essential to understand the transformation pathway of different P species in biochar mediated by soil microorganisms, as soil microorganisms are closely related to the mineralization, immobilization, redox reaction, and solubilization of various nutrients in the soil. However, this process has largely been ignored by previous studies. Here, two sludge biochars produced at different temperature (400 and 700 °C, denoted as B400 and B700) were incubated with a phosphate-solubilizing microorganism (i.e., Pseudomonas putida (P. putida)) that is closely involved in soil P turnover. The release pattern and transformation of biochar-P were investigated in both abiotic and biotic conditions. The results demonstrate that the release of biochar-P could be enhanced by P. putida. The P species in B400 were more vulnerable to P. putida than those in B700, as the P species in B400 had lower polymerization degree and poorer crystal structure than those in B700 did. The Pyro-P released from biochar could be easily transformed into Ortho-P by P. putida, which can further benefit other species in soil. This study provides insights on the release and transformation of sludge biochar-P mediated by PSM and reveals the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on biochar-P release and transformation which is essential for the production and application of sewage sludge biochar.},

	abstract = {Waste management is necessary for environmental and economic sustainability, but it depends upon socioeconomic, political, and environmental factors. More countries are shifting toward recycling as compared to landfilling; thus, different researchers have presented the zero waste concept, considering the importance of sustainability. This review was conducted to provide information about different well established and new/emerging technologies which could be used to recover nutrients from wastes and bring zero waste concepts in practical life. Technologies can be broadly divided into the triangle of nutrient accumulation, extraction, and release. Physicochemical mechanisms, plants, and microorganisms (algae and prokaryotic) could be used to accumulate nutrients. Extraction of nutrient is possible through electrodialysis and crystallization while nutrient release can occur via thermochemical and biochemical treatments. Primary nutrients, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are used globally and are non-renewable. Augmented upsurges in prices of inorganic fertilizers and required discharge restrictions on nutrients have stimulated technological developments. Thus, well-proven technologies, such as biochar, composting, vermicomposting, composting with biochar, pyrolysis, and new emerging technologies (forward osmosis and electro-dialysis) have potential to recover nutrients from wastes. Therefore, reviewing the present and imminent potential of these technologies for adaptation of nutrient recycling from wastes is of great importance. Since waste management is a significant concern all over the globe and technologies, e.g., landfill, combustion, incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification, are available to manage generated wastes, they have adverse impacts on society and on the environment. Thus, climate-friendly technologies, such as composting, biodegradation, and anaerobic decomposition, with the generation of non-biodegradable wastes need to be adopted to ensure a sustainable future environment. Furthermore, environmental impacts of technology could be quantified by life cycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, LCA could be used to evaluate the performance of different environmentally-friendly technologies in waste management and in the designing of future policies. LCA, in combination with other approaches, may prove helpful in the development of strategies and policies for the selection of dynamic products and processes.},

	abstract = {As a promising soil amendment, biochar has demonstrated its potential for influencing soil nutrient transformations. The effects of biochar on soil phosphorus (P) transformations have received much less attention than its effects on carbon cycling. A review of the literature reveals that biochar applications to soils may have notable effects on the abundance, speciation, availability, and leaching loss of soil P. However, a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the biochar-induced environmental behavior of soil P has not been obtained so far. Therefore, in this review, we analyzed and identified the known and potential mechanisms through which biochar affects P behavior in soils: (1) biochar as a source of P provides soluble and exchangeable P to soil; (2) biochar enhances the availability of endogenic soil P by influencing P-related complexation and metabolism effects; and (3) biochar affects P leaching losses directly or indirectly by adsorbing P, improving P retention by soil, and facilitating P assimilation by plants. By presenting a broad and detailed illustration of P behaviors in biochar-amended soils, this paper suggests that the application of biochar to soils will help enlarge soil P pools, increase soil P availability, and decrease P leaching losses from soil. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the long-term effects of biochar addition on soil P transformations, explore how biochar-derived dissolved organic matter (BDOM) affects the mobility and availability of soil mineral-associated P, and examine the transport of particulate P in biochar-amended soils.},

Most P utilized by human activities eventually converges into various solid biowastes, such as crop biomass, animal manures, and sewage sludges. Therefore, integration of efficient P recovery practices into solid biowaste management will not only significantly reduce the dependence on limited geological P resources but also reduce P runoff and related water contamination issues associated with traditional waste management strategies. This study reviews the applications of (hydro)thermal techniques for the treatment of solid biowastes, which can greatly facilitate P recovery in addition to waste volume reduction, decontamination, and energy recovery. Research showed that P speciation (including molecular moiety, complexation state, and mineralogy) can experience significant changes during (hydro)thermal treatments, and are impacted by treatment techniques and conditions. Changes in P speciation and overall properties of the products can alter the mobility and bioavailability of P, and subsequent P reclamation and recycling efficiency of the treatment products. This review summarizes recent progresses in this direction, identifies the challenges and knowledge gaps, and provides a foundation for future research efforts targeting at sustainable management of nutrient-rich biowastes.},

Combustion temperature does not affect phosphorus leaching with oxalic acid. A contact time of 2h and an oxalic acid load of 10kgkg-1 of P seem sufficient for phosphorus extraction. Almost all phosphorus present in gasification ash is leached after 2h with both sulphuric and oxalic acid using an acid load of 14kgkg-1 of P.

This study conducted experiments on heavy metal removal by adding chlorinating agents (PVC, NaCl, MgCl2, CaCl2) during sludge pyrolysis. The chlorides addition can largely remove heavy metals by achieving the highest removal efficiency with dosage of 80 g(Cl)/kg(dry sludge) at 700 °C. The most effective removal effect was observed for Zn, Mn, Cu and Pb, with removal efficiency from 37.44\% to 99.45\%, 5.24\% to 93.64\%, 9.11\% to 86.15\% and 16.57\% to 90.75\%, respectively for the sludge before and after chlorination. Furthermore, the P-solubility in neutral ammonium citrate (Pnac) was enhanced after chlorination and the maximum P-solubility can be obtained at 700 °C for each series. After 700 °C pyrolysis, the P-solubility was significantly increased from 40.08\% of the sludge biochar to 72.07\%, 74.05\%, 74.00\% and 76.57\% of the biochar obtained after adding PVC, NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2, respectively. The highest P-solubility was observed in samples with MgCl2 due to the formation of Mg3(PO4)2. This study proposed a novel method to use the sludge biochar as potential P-fertilizer with effective heavy metal removal, finally achieving a “waste-to-resource” strategy for integrated management of sewage sludge.},

	abstract = {Reclaiming abundant phosphorus from sewage sludge (SS) via pyrolysis for use as a fertilizer has gained increasing attention owing to the rapid depletion of global P reserves. In this study, the enhancement effect of Ca-based additives on sludge P transformation to hydroxylapatite through pyrolysis was systematically investigated. Three Ca-based additives were added in the pyrolysis of SS, and they were found to promote the conversion of sludge P to hydroxylapatite, which is bioavailable to plants. The characterization of the sludge-derived pyrochars indicated that the addition of 10\% CaO, 5\% Ca(OH)2, or 10\% Ca3(PO4)2 facilitated peak hydroxylapatite production. The thermodynamic simulation of the production of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis showed that these additives increased the enthalpy of the pyrolysis system. Furthermore, the pyrolysis with CaO addition had the lowest enthalpy, thereby suggesting that the addition of CaO during sludge pyrolysis was preferable for recovering sludge P in the form of hydroxylapatite. Moreover, the hydroxylapatite produced with these additives was unstable when the pyrolysis temperature was above 900 °C. The pot experiment demonstrated the feasibility using the sludge-derived pyrochars as P fertilizer for plant growth. Therefore, changing the Ca form and/or Ca/P ratio with the addition of Ca-based additives could be an effective strategy for reclaiming P from SS in the form of hydroxylapatite, and this demonstrates a pathway for global P sustainability by recycling P from P-abundant wastes.},

The mobility and bioavailability of P is closely related to its speciation, but knowledge gap in P speciation is still existed which needs to be narrowed by a systematic study including existing experimental methods and techniques as well as theoretical prediction. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of P speciation, this study conducted a series of research combining conventional fractionation of P with consideration of major concomitant elements (Al, Ca, Fe), advanced analytical techniques (solution and solid-state 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD)), and theoretical simulation with respect to solubility of major elements in different acid-base extractants. Results showed that Ca and Fe were dominantly extracted by HCl whereas P and Al were both NaOH- and HCl-soluble. Inorganic orthophosphates were detected as predominant molecular configurations of P from solution 31P NMR spectra, while the existence of calcium and aluminum orthophosphates was revealed by solid-state 31P NMR. Moreover, the poor-crystalline AlPO4 mineral was further evidenced by XRD patterns of the sewage sludge and biochar. Finally, a theoretical simulation of P-containing minerals was performed on the basis of results above, which suggested the existence of variscite/berlinite and amorphous Ca3(PO4)2 in the sludge and biochar. This study does not only explore the P speciation in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar, but also provides a methodology for further research on P speciation. Through the intensive study on the environmental behavior of P, this work might further contribute to the fundamental knowledge basis for the recycle of P during integrate waste management.},

	abstract = {(Hydro)thermal treatments of sewage sludge is a promising option that can simultaneously target safe waste disposal, energy recovery, and nutrient recovery/recycling. The speciation of phosphorus (P) in sludge is of great relevance to P reclamation/recycling and soil application of sludge-derived products, thus it is critical to understand the effects of different treatment techniques and conditions on P speciation. This study systematically characterized P speciation (i.e. complexation and mineral forms) in chars derived from pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of municipal sewage sludges. Combined sequential extraction and P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy analysis revealed the dependence of P transformation on treatment conditions and metal composition in the feedstocks. Pyrolysis of sludges decreased the relative abundance of phytic acid while increased the abundance of Al-associated P. HTC thoroughly homogenized and exposed P for interaction with various metals/minerals, with the final P speciation closely related to the composition/speciation of metals and their affinities to P. Results from this study revealed the mechanisms of P transformation during (hydro)thermal treatments of sewage sludges, and might be applicable to other biosolids. It also provided fundamental knowledge basis for the design and selection of waste management strategies for better P (re)cycling and reclamation.},

However, SSB presents a diversity of P compounds, mainly in mineral forms with different degrees of chemical stability. This hinders the prediction of P bioavailability. In the present study we evaluated P solubility and bioavailability using different chemical extractants. Additionally, the relationships between extractable P and physicochemical properties were evaluated for SSB obtained over a wide range of temperatures (200 °C; 300 °C; 500 °C and 600 °C). Available phosphorus content was extracted using 2\% citric acid (P-CA), neutral ammonium citrate + water (P-NAC) and Mehlich 1 solution (0.0125 mol L À1 H 2 SO 4 + 0.050 mol L À1 HCl). Physicochemical properties and extractable P were strongly affected by pyrolysis temperature. Higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in increased pH, BET surface area, pore volume, ash, fixed carbon, Ca, Mg and Zn contents, as well as formation of stable Ca minerals (calcite and oxalate). The total P content increased with pyrolysis temperature (!300 °C). Nevertheless, the solubility of biochar-P in the extractants presented different trends with temperature. The P-NAC content reached a maximum (79\% of TP) at 300 °C and then declined at higher temperatures. Only at 600 °C P-CA and available P were affected by the temperature, where the P-CA increased and available P decreased. Therefore, it is recommended that the P solubility in different extractants should be considered when using SSB as an alternative to inorganic P fertilizers.},

This study explores the potential of phosphate adsorption using chars produced from anaer-obically digested food waste. Two types of feedstocks, dried solid digestate (DSD) and pelletized solid digestate (PSD) are used to produce chars via pyrolysis between 300 and 900 C. The maximum P sorption capacity of DSD char (100.7 mg-P/g-char) was more superior than that of PSD char (66.0 mg-P/ g-char). The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) result suggests that P was mainly captured by Ca in the chars via the formation of hydroxyapatite. The P speciation and exterior surfaces in chars before and after P exposure (P-laden chars) are quantitatively characterized using 31 P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Orthophosphate was found to be dominant in both digestate chars and P-laden chars, and the P capture role of nano-sized CaO formed from digestate pyrolysis at 700 C was observed. The results suggest that chars produced from food waste digestate can reclaim exogenous phosphate. In addition, the P-laden chars rich in hydroxyapatite can be applied as a slow-release P fertilizer or soil remediation agents.},

	abstract = {Sludge contains a high content of phosphorus (P) which makes the recovery of P from this material attractive. Inorganic apatite phosphorus (AP) could be utilized as a slow-release P fertilizer in a long term, thus transforming P-containing compounds into AP is greatly attractive. Herein, the migration and transformation behaviors of P from two municipal sewage sludge and a food-processing sludge were investigated during pyrolysis, and the effects of two calcium-based conditioners (CaO and CaCl 2) on the formation of AP were explored. The results showed that nearly all P remained in sludge below 650 • C but around 22.5-49.0\% P released from that at 850 • C, respectively. CaO helped retain phosphorus in sewage sludge at 850 • C, while CaCl 2 facilitates its volatilization. Even though, the generation of AP was still improved under the effect of CaCl 2. AP amount increased by 7.1-37.5\% in food sludge derived char while AP amount increased by 7.3\% to 21 times in sewage sludge derived char because of the two calcium-based conditioners. Model experiments showed that CaO could react with non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) to generate calcium pyrophosphate and calcium ortho-phosphate, and CaCl 2 could react with NAIP to form calcium pyrophosphate, calcium chlorapatite and phos-phide. In general, CaCl 2 exhibited a more excellent effect on the formation of AP than CaO while CaO showed more stable performance on the retention of TP.},

Interest in P recovery from PSSC is likely to increase as pyrolysis is becoming viewed as a more economical method of sewage sludge thermal treatment compared to incineration. The P contents of ISSA and PSSC are 7.2-7.5\% and 5.6\%, respectively. Relative to the sludge, P concentrations are increased about 8-fold in ISSA, compared to roughly 3-fold in PSSC. Both PSSC and ISSA contain whitlock-ite, an unusual form of calcium phosphate, with PSSC containing more whitlockite than ISSA. Acid leach-ing experiments indicate that a liquid/solid ratio of 10 with 30 min contact time is optimal to release PO 4-P into leachate for both ISSA and PSSC. The proportion of P extracted from PSSC is higher due to its higher whitlockite content. Heavy metals are less soluble from PSSC because they are more strongly incorporated in the particles. The results suggest there is potential for the development of a process to recover P from PSSC.},

For carbonization at 430 C a lab-pyrolysis reactor was used. The feedstocks and pyrolysis products were characterized (pH, electrical conductivity, FTIR, SEM, CHNS elemental composition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and toxic metal concentration). The obtained results explored the possibility of sewage sludge conversion by pyrolysis process to stable and valuable products with a 2-to 3-fold increase of phosphorus content. Using DTPA extraction protocol we confirmed the good stability of toxic metals in both sewage sludge pyrolysis products compared to feedstocks. The incorporation of pyrolysis products into P-deficient and toxic metal polluted soil was effective to reduce pollutant mobility and to add available phosphorus. Our characterization study highlighted the potential of pyrolysis for closure of the phosphorus cycle and for the production of fertilizers from complex materials such as sewage sludge.},

In this study, a method to reduce the emission of NO x precursors (e.g., hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH 3)) while simultaneously reclaim more plant-available P was proposed through pyrolyzing ferric sludge (sludge conditioned by Fenton's reagents) rather than raw sludge. The nitrogen and phosphorus transformation at different pyrolysis temperatures was investigated. The results indicated that in comparison with the pyrolysis of raw sludge, the remaining iron compounds in ferric sludge can fix char-N in more stable forms (e.g., appearance of pyrrole-N at 900 °C). The secondary cracking of amine-N compounds in tar-N (e.g., 81.67\% increase of amine-N at 900 °C) can be inhibited. Hence, more amine-N was remained and less heterocyclic-N and nitrile-N compounds were generated in tar{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}N. Less generation of NH 3-N and HCN-N was also observed in NO x precursors (e.g., 5.46\% decrease of NH 3-N and 6.91\% decrease of HCN-N at 900 °C). Moreover, the results of X-ray diffractometry, liquid 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic, and chemical analyses collectively indicated that iron present in ferric sludge also favored reclamation of more plant-available P. In comparison with the pyrolysis of raw sludge, an increase in the total phosphorus pool was noted (18.06-36.26 versus 15.54-30.59 mg g −1 dry solids). A decrease in mobility with the predominant P as sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-P, and an increase in plant-available P can be also obtained. This study indicated that pyrolysis of ferric sludge was a feasible way to simultaneously reduce emission of NO x precursors, reclaim plant-available P, and reuse ferric sludge.},

However, high levels of toxic compounds and low phosphorus bioavailability in sewage sludge are the main factors limiting its direct agricultural use. This paper proposes a low-temperature combustion method that can enrich the phosphorus in sludge ash. Low temperature-treated sewage sludge ash (LTSA) at different oxygen concentrations (20\%, 60\%, 100\%) were obtained through a specific experimental device. Then, the species and leaching characteristics of phosphorus in LTSAs were analyzed and compared with pyrolysis sewage sludge char (PSSC) and incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA). Results show that low-temperature combustion of sludge increased the total phosphorus content in the bottom ash by 45.6\%, and the bioavailable phosphorus content increased 2.9 times. Further, by increasing the concentration of oxygen while carrying out low-temperature combustion of sludge, part of the non-apatite inorganic P was converted to apatite P (AP), resulting in a 46.3\% increase in AP in the sludge. Low-temperature combustion can also convert heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in the sludge from an easily leachable form (acid extractable fraction and reducible fraction) to a stable form (reducible fraction) and decrease the leaching of heavy metals. Leaching of Cr and Cu decreased by 97.56\% and 98.52\%, respectively.},

The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate chars produced by pyrolysis and hydrothermal car-bonization (HTC) of sewage sludge, so-called sewchars, under varying process conditions in terms of their soil amelioration potential. Three different sewage sludges, two pyrolysis and four HTC sewchars were evaluated with respect to their stability in soil, perspective for nutrient recycling and potential use as soil amendments. The sewchars were produced at different temperatures (pyrolytic low temperature conversion LTC 400 • C; PYREG pyrolysis 700 • C; HTC 180-200 • C) and for varying treatment times (LTC and PYREG 1 h; HTC: 4-8 h). O/C and H/C ratios of about 0.7 and 1.8 respectively, indicated that HTC sewchars will tend to be less recalcitrant in soils than pyrolysis sewchars. The duration and temperature of HTC correlated positively with the chars' contents of adsorbed labile carbon and nitrogen compounds. However, HTC failed to increase the chars' resin-extractable phosphorus contents. The cation exchange capacity of sewage sludge was reduced by HTC but stayed on a higher level than after pyrolysis. With increasing treatment temperature, the pH, ash (content) as well as macro-and micronutrient contents increased. Pyrolysis sewchars also accumulated heavy metals; however their contents were lower than those reported previously. An enrichment of heavy metals was also observed for the HTC sewchars, albeit to a much lesser extent.},

Rhizobacteria did not affect shoot biomass or P content. The results show that red clover might have mobilized substantial amounts of P. Sequential P fractionation was not suitable to predict the efficacy of the fertilizers. Generally, the sewage sludge-based fertilizers tested proved to be suitable alternative P sources relevant to organic farming systems. However, the efficacy of recycled fertilizers is strongly dependent on their specific production conditions.},

	abstract = {Aims: Dried sewage sludge (SS) and the by-products of four SS thermal conversion processes (pyrolysis, incineration and two types of gasification) were investigated for phosphorus (P) availability. Methods: A sequential extraction was used to determine the distribution of P among different P pools. After mixing materials with soil, availability of the P was determined with soil P extractions and in a growth experiment with wheat. Results: Thermally converted SS contained a greater proportion of P within recalcitrant pools than dried SS. Despite having very different P pool distributions, the incinerated and dried SS provided similar amounts of P to plants. Plant P supply from dried and incinerated SS was lower than the comparable soluble P treatment (50 mg P kg−1), but higher than a soluble treatment at a lower rate (20 mg P kg−1). Plant P uptake in gasified and pyrolysed treatments was only marginally greater than uptake in a control (no P) treatment. Plant P uptake correlated most closely with diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) P analysis of soil-material mixes. Phosphorus availability in the dried and incinerated SS treatments increased over time. Conclusions: We propose that the dried and incinerated SS have potential as slow release P fertilisers in low pH soils.},

To explore their effects, inorganic salts containing Ca, Al, chlorine, sulfate and phosphate were added into sewage sludge prior to pyrolysis at 500 °C. The ash content, yield and pH changed depending on salt species. Salt-addition catalyzed the decomposition of organic matters and decreased the contents of C, H, N and S. Some of the intrinsic minerals were lost or converted while new minerals were formed involving the added and intrinsic ions. The retention of Cu, Mn, Zn and Pb was reduced at the presence of excessive chlorine. Sulfate moderately promoted volatiliza-tion, while phosphate offset the effect of chlorine. Chlorine transformed residual fraction of Pb to exchangeable fraction, while sulfate inhibited the transformation of heavy metals from mobile to immobile fractions. Phosphate increased the residual fraction. The mechanisms included direct reactions between the added anions and heavy metals, and altered affinity between heavy metals and the organic and mineral components. The presence of inorganic salts affects char characteristics and heavy metal risks, which should be considered in char production and application.},

HTC has a great advantage considering the economic efficiency of its process operation due to its reduced energy consumption and production of solid fuel upgraded through the increased fixed carbon and heating value. The ash of sewage sludge, however, contains up to 52.55\% phosphate, which degrades the efficiency of the thermochemical conversion process such as pyrolysis, combustion, and gasification by causing slagging. In this study, three kinds of organic acids, i.e., oxalic, tartaric, and citric acid, were selected to eliminate phosphorus from hydrochars produced through the HTC of sewage sludge. The efficiency of the phosphorus removal and the properties of the corresponding HTC hydrochars were analyzed by adding 20 mmoles of organic acids per 1 g of phosphorus in the HTC sample. In addition, the phosphorus reduction effect and the applicability to an upgrading process were verified. Oxalic acid was selected as the most appropriate organic acid considering the economic efficiency of its process operation. Furthermore, the optimal conditions were selected by analyzing the efficiency of the phosphorus elimination and the characteristic property of the HTC hydrochars with the weight fraction of oxalic acid.},

	abstract = {(Hydro)thermal treatments of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment process can significantly reduce waste volume and transform sludge into valuable products such as pyrochar and hydrochar. Given the global concern with phosphorus (P) resource depletion, P recycling/reclamation from or direct soil application of the derived chars can be potential P recycling practices. In order to evaluate P recyclability as well as the selection and optimization of treatment techniques, it is critical to understand the effects of different treatment techniques and conditions on P speciation and distribution. In the present study, we systematically characterized P speciation in chars derived from thermal (i.e., pyrolysis) and hydrothermal treatments of municipal sewage sludge using complementary chemical extraction and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods. P species in the raw activated sludge was dominated by orthophosphate and long-chain polyphosphates, whereas increased amounts of pyrophosphate and short-chain polyphosphates formed after pyrolysis at 250-600 °C. In contrast, hydrothermal treatments resulted in the production of only inorganic orthophosphate in the hydrochar. In addition to the change of molecular speciation, thermal treatments also altered the physical state and extractability of different P species in the pyrochars from pyrolysis, with both total P and polyphosphate being less extractable with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Results from this study suggest that P speciation and availability in sludge-derived chars are tunable by varying treatment techniques and conditions, and provide fundamental knowledge basis for the design and selection of waste management strategies for better nutrient (re)cycling and reclamation.},

This work used Mg/Ca-modified bio-chars to take up P from the acid-extract from ISSA at low pH ({\textless}2), which simplified the previous P recycling process. The hypothesis is to produce a P-enriched post-sorption biochar that can be directly applied as a P fertilizer. Wastes of peanut shell and sugarcane bagasse were used to synthesize Mg/Ca-modified biochars at pyrolysis temperatures of 450 C, 700 C and 850 C. Preliminary results indicated Mg-modified sugarcane bagasse biochar pyrolysed at 700 C produced optimal P-absorption. This biochar was positively charged and had a high specific surface area (1440 m 2 /g), consistent with a layered porous structure. The optimal biochar showed rapid adsorption of P which could be described by the pseudo-second-order model. Successful adsorption of P from the acid-extract by the optimal biochar was mainly due to chemical precipitation and its adsorption capacity is 129.79 mg P/g biochar.},

The aim of this study was to fabricate a P compound fertilizer by using an optimal SS-derived biochar (SSB) with enhanced inherent Ca-P content to load P from the P extract of ISSA. For this purpose, SS was impregnated with four agents (MgCl2, CaCl2, MgO, and CaO) at mass ratios of 20 or 10\% and pyrolyzed at 700 or 300 °C. Characterization of the produced SSBs indicated that those with 20\% MgCl2, CaO, and MgO added and pyrolyzed at 700 °C exhibited high surface areas, abundant mesopores, and abundant plant-valuable P. When in contact with the P extract, these three SSBs showed the highest P adsorption efficiencies among the obtained SSBs but CaO/MgO-impregnated SSBs have more metal coprecipitation. The postsorption SSBs were P-enhanced and alkalinity decreased, which are favorable for fertilizer application. Furthermore, a pot experiment verified that these three postsorption SSBs had a comparable P fertilizer effect to that of the commercial P fertilizer. Therefore, the MgCl2-impregnated SSB with P loading from the ISSA extract has potential as a P fertilizer alternative that can support global P sustainability by reclaiming P from SS and ISSA.},

Pyrolysis could be the ideal treatment for materials, such as sewage sludge (SS), producing a safe, nutrient-rich biochar product while sequestering the inherent carbon (C). However, pyrolyzed sewage sludge typically contains low levels of potassium (K) and plant available P, making the material rather unsuitable for use as fertilizer. Here, a novel treatment was investigated to produce an optimized P and K biochar fertilizer. We doped sewage sludge with a low-cost mineral (2 and 5\% potassium acetate) and pyrolyzed it at 700 °C. The percentage water extractable of the total P content in biochar increased by 237 times with 5\% K addition compared to the undoped biochar. After six water extractions, all of the K and 16\% of P were obtained. Further optimization is feasible through adjustments of the biochar pH or doping the feedstock with other forms of K. Using X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, we identified highly soluble potassium hydrogen phosphate up to 200-300 μm below the biochar surface. This simple and cost-effective modification enables the use of sewage sludge as safe biochar fertilizer with tailored P availability that also supplies K, improves soil properties, and sequesters C.},

Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) can improve sludge disintegration and biogas production. Phosphorus (P) is immobilized on hydrochars of sewage sludge (SS). It is critical to understand changes in P speciation in SS hydrochars under different reaction temperatures and reaction times during THP for reclamation and (re)cy-cling of P. This study combined sequential extraction, 31 P liquid and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to systematically analyze variation in P speciation and related metals in hydrochars. The temperature of the THP has more influence on P extraction content than reaction time; the bioavailability of P from hydrochars declined with increasing temperature. A 31 P liquid and solid-state NMR analysis demonstrated that orthophosphate was the most abundant phosphate present small deviations in the chemical shift were observed in different samples under different conditions. The results of XANES demonstrated that Ca{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}P was more stable than Fe{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}P and Al {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}P. LCF results suggested OcataCa proportion raised under stable Ca{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}P ratio in samples when the temperature was above 155 °C and duration was 60 min.

	abstract = {Biochar derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) sludge could be a potential phosphorus (P) fertilizer. Soil microorganisms play a regulating role on the turnover of P in soil. When the EBPR sludge biochar is added to soil, it would inevitably interact with soil microorganisms. Thus, for the wise use of the EBPR sludge biochar, it is imperative to understand the interaction between the biochar and soil microorganisms. In this study, Pseudomonas putida (P. putida), a common soil microorganism , was applied to investigate the biotransformation of P in two EBPR sludge biochars. The results reveal that P released from biochar produced at 700 C (E700) was more easily absorbed by P. putida than that released from biochar produced at 400 C (E400). This is attributed to the higher polyphosphates (poly-P) content in E700 and poly-P has higher affinity to P. putida surface compared to orthophosphates. Furthermore, E400 has a negative effect on intracellular poly-P formation in P. putida, which is probably caused by the oxidative stress induced by the free radicals from E400. As intracellular poly-P plays a critical role on bacteria survival and their interaction with surrounding environment, high-temperature biochar (E700) in this case would be more suitable for soil remediation.},

Nutrient rich wastes were mainly researched for production of biochar straight (single nutrient) fertilizer through slow pyrolysis. Appropriate waste feedstocks and cleaner thermal processing need to be explored for value addition. In present study, potassium (K) containing banana peduncle and phosphorus (P) rich effluent sludge (chemical fertilizer industry) wastes co-utilized for development of biochar complex fertilizer. Different thermal treatments viz slow pyrolysis (700 C) and thermal plasma processing (1200e1500 C) were trialed for production of biochars with desired characteristics. Plasma processing produced biochar with higher total P (8.53 e 11.81 \%) and K (17.13 e 21.9 \%) than slow pyrolysis (P-4.2 \% and K-11.5 \%). In contrast, slow pyrolysis resulted higher biochar yield (42 \%) and total carbon content (34.1 \%) than in plasma (28 e 34 \% and 10.9 e 21.8 \%). Bio-available phosphorus of effluent sludge (600 mg/kg) enhanced to 4500 e 6000 and 5600 mg/kg in plasma and slow pyrolysis biochars. XRD analysis indicates the presence of P as hydroxyapatite in sludge and biochars. The K was dominantly present as kalicinite (KHCO 3) in slow pyrolysis and fairchildite [K 2 Ca (CO 3) 2 ] specifically in plasma biochar. Biochars contained lesser total (0.18 e1.55 \%) and leachable (0.014 e 0.034 \%) fluoride than effluent sludge i.e. 3.45 and 0.076 \%. These results demonstrate utilization potential of aforementioned wastes and thermal processes for the production of K and P enriched biochar complex fertilizer.

	abstract = {• Optimal HTL conditions could recover 58\% energy of the MSS with a EROI value of 3.5. • Increasing HTL reaction time reduced the TOC and increased TN in APL. • Metals concentrations in the biochar get reduced compared to raw MSS. • TP in the biochar increased with increase in HTL reaction time. Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) could be a promising and better alternative to other techniques for energy recovery from municipal sewage sludge (MSS). However, the nutrients (i.e., N, and P) recovery potential from the byproducts, generated in the HTL of MSS, needs to be studied so that a comprehensive sludge management practice could be adopted. In this study, HTL process temperature (275-400 °C), and reaction time (30-120 min) were first investigated for biocrude yield and release of the nutrients to the aqueous phase liquid (APL) and bio-char. The maximum energy recovery (i.e., 59\%) and maximum energy return on investment (i.e., 3.5) were obtained at 350 °C and 60 min of holding time. With the increase in HTL reaction time, the concentration of nitrogen in the APL increased (5.1 to 6.8 mg/L) while the concentration of phosphorus decreased (0.89 to 0.22 mg/L); the opposite was observed for the biochar. The nutrient recycling efficiency from the APL using microalgae was found to be strain-specific; nitrogen recycling efficiency by Picochlorum sp. and Chlorella sp. were 95.4 and 58.6\%, respectively. The APL, derived from 1 kg MSS, could potentially produce 0.49 kg microalgal biomass. Since the concentrations of various metals in the biochar samples were substantially lower compared to their concentrations in raw MSS, the application of biochar as a soil conditioner could be very promising. Overall, net positive energy could be recovered from MSS using the HTL process, while the nutrients in the APL could be used to cultivate specific microalgae, and biochar could be applied to enhance the soil quality.},

	abstract = {Measures to improve the use of phosphorus (P), either by improved efficiency or reuse, are needed worldwide in order to preserve a finite resource and ensure that farmers have access to it. Currently, the rapidly growing global population has generated an increased demand for this mineral. Sustainably disposing for the massive amount of globally produced biosolids and alternative sources of P for agriculture are two major challenges to address. In this scenario, biosolids-derived biochar (BBC) has been presented as a win-win opportunity. However, the BBC-P dynamics in soil over consecutive cropping seasons remain unclear. Direct (first and second cropping season) and residual (third and fourth cropping season) effects of BBC on soil P fractions, P uptake and corn grain yield were assessed. Additionally, the relationships between soil P pools and grain yield were investigated by multivariate and multiple linear regression analysis. In a field experiment, BBC produced at 300 °C (BC 300) and 500 °C (BC 500) were applied to an Oxisol at a rate of 15 t ha−1. Soil total P and its fractions (organic P, inorganic P, and available P) were determined. Phosphorus uptake and corn grain yield were also evaluated. BBC, regardless of pyrolysis temperature, increased soil total P and all P fractions. Moreover, BBC maintained high soil P contents for at least two years after stopping its application. These results suggest that BBC may act as a slow-release P fertilizer. Surprisingly, soil P fractions were unaffected by different pyrolysis temperatures, but BC 300 promoted higher grain yield than BC 500 in the third and fourth cropping seasons. Overall, the results confirmed that under direct application both biochars can replace mineral fertilization for corn production; and when considering the residual effect, BC 300 showed a higher potential to be utilized as a soil amendment for P supply.},

	abstract = {A novel technique for phosphorus recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was developed using biochar derived from iron−rich sludge (dewatered sludge conditioned with Fenton's reagent). The biochar pyrolyzed from iron−rich sludge at a low temperature of 300 °C (referred to as Fe−300 biochar) showed a better phosphorus (P) adsorption capacity (most of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate) than biochars pyrolyzed at other higher temperatures of 500–900 °C, with the maximum P adsorption capacity of up to 1.843 mg g−1 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate. Adsorption isotherms study indicated that 70\% P was precipitated through chemical reaction with Fe elements, i.e., Fe(II) and Fe(III) existed on the surface of the Fe−300 biochar, and other 30\% was through surface physical adsorption as simulated by a dual Langmuir-Langmuir model using the potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH2PO4) as a model solution. The seed germination rate was increased up to 92\% with the addition of Fe−300 biochar after adsorbing most of P, compared with 66\% without the addition of biochar. Moreover, P adsorbed by the chemical reaction in form of iron hydrogen phosphate can be solubilized by a phosphate-solubilizing microorganism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with the total solubilized P amount of 3.045 mg g−1 at the end of an incubation of 20 days. This study indicated that the iron−rich sludge−derived biochar could be used as a novel and beneficial functional material for P recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate. The recovered P with biochar can be re-utilized in garden soil as an efficient P−fertilizer, thus increasing the added values of both the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and the iron−rich sludge.},

MW-HTC changed the physicochemical properties of hydrochars, nutrient fractions (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)), and surface functional groups which were characterized by various analysis tools. The N contents in hydrochars derived from rapeseed (RS) and lincomycin (LM) residues were 7.26 and 7.76\% at 120 °C, respectively. At 210 °C, those values were reduced to 5.16 and 3.14\% accordingly, indicating a higher temperature led to more N release. The speciation of P fractions was affected by temperature, and LM derived hydrochars possessed higher bioavailable P for plants' nutrient uptake. The atomic ratios of H/C and O/C decreased with treatment temperature for both RS and LM derived hydrochars. LM derived hydrochars were thermally more stable than RS derived hydrochars. RS derived hydrochars exhibited better higher heating value (HHV; 22.0-26.8 MJ/kg) while LM derived hydrochars revealed higher fuel ratio (0.47-0.95). MW-HTC offered a viable route for conversion of P-and N-enriched agricultural and antibiotic residues into highly efficient hydrochars for environment-friendly applications.},

	abstract = {Biological and thermochemical sanitization of source-separated human solid waste (HSW) are effective technologies for unsewered communities. While both methods are capable of fecal pathogen sterilization, the agronomically-beneficial properties of waste sanitized between methods remains unclear. Therefore, this study compared recovery and quality of soil amendments produced by compostation, torrefaction, and pyrolysis of HSW, established their financial value, and quantified tradeoffs between product value and conversion efficiency. Temperature and associated mass losses significantly affected the physical and chemical properties of thermochemically-treated HSW. Thermophilic composting, a biological sanitation method practiced in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, produced an amendment that contained between 16 and 858-fold more plant-available nitrogen (N; 214.5 mg N/kg) than HSW pyrolyzed between 300 and 700 °C (0.2–15.2 mg N/kg). Conversely, HSW pyrolyzed at 600 °C had four-fold higher plant-available phosphorus (P; 3117 mg P/kg) and five-fold higher plant-available potassium (K; 7403 mg K/kg) than composted HSW (716 mg P/kg and 1462 mg K/kg). Wide variation between international fertilizer prices on the low end and regional East African prices on the high end resulted in broad-spaced quantiles for the value of agronomic components in HSW amendments. Phosphorus and K comprised a disproportionate amount of the value, 52–87\%, compared to plant-available N, which contributed less than 2\%. The total value of treated HSW, summed across all agronomic components per unit weight amendment, was greatest for thermochemically-treated HSW at 600 °C, averaging 220 USD/Mg, more than four-fold that of composted HSW, 53 USD/Mg. In contrast, torrefaction provided the highest monetary value per unit weight feedstock, 144 USD/Mg, as low heating temperatures engender minimal mass loss and higher nutrient densities per unit weight feedstock, compared to composted or pyrolyzed HSW. When benchmarked against total N, P, and K of eight commonly-applied organic amendments, including sewage-sludge (Milorganite), compost, and alfalfa meal, HSW pyrolyzed at 700 °C was of greatest value per unit weight of amendment, 365 USD/Mg, compared to 89 USD/Mg for composted HSW, and contained 2.9\% total N (0.5 mg available N/kg), 3.1\% total P (7640 mg available P/kg), 3.5\% total K (17,671 mg available K/kg).},

	abstract = {The reclamation of phosphorus (P) in wetland biomass is a potential strategy to alleviate the P resource shortage, and (hydro)thermal treatment is considered a promising technique for biomass waste treatment and valuable product manufacturing. In order to understand the evolution of P during the (hydro)thermal process, we systematically determined P speciation during pyrolysis (300-600 °C) and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC, 200-260 °C) of Napier grass via combining 31P NMR, XRD, and sequential chemical extraction, and the derived chars were characterized. The biochars showed higher pH, higher ash content as well as greater stability, and the hydrochars had more oxygen-containing groups and better energy density. Temperature-dependent (hydro)thermal treatments can effectively reduce the risk of P leaching loss by transforming P into stable pools. Pyrolysis could increase the portion of potentially plant-available P (NaHCO3-Pi) from 3.6\% to 29.0\% with increasing pyrolysis temperature, while HTC treatment favored the formation of more stable P pools (HCl-P). Ortho-P (93.4\%) and monoester-P (6.6\%) were the main P species in Napier grass, while a considerate amount of amorphous pyrophosphate (20.0-40.3\%) formed after pyrolysis. In contrast, orthophosphate (e.g., Ca3(PO4)2) was the dominant P species in hydrochars. Therefore, P availability and speciation are greatly affected by (hydro)thermal treatment conditions, and these findings provide guidance for P reclamation and biomass waste utilization.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal carbonization has been considered effective to reduce sewage sludge volume and provide an opportunity to generate valuable byproducts for a wide range of potential applications. The fate and distribution of nutrients during hydrothermal carbonization of sewage sludge, along with that of heavy metals, is very important for realizing nutrient recovery and reuse by both hydrochar and liquid phase directly as soil amendments and/or organic fertilizer. In this study, we systematically investigated the migration and transformation of nutrients and heavy metals using chemical extractions and reaction severity (Ruyter model) methods at a temperature range of 120–300 °C for 30–180 min. With increasing reaction severity, carbon and nitrogen efficiency of hydrochar showed a liner and exponential decrease respectively, while phosphorus accumulated positively in hydrochar. Nitrogen species in hydrochar are mostly nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles whereas in liquid phase are predominantly ammonia-N and organic-N. The organic phosphorus in sewage sludge was transformed to inorganic species but non-apatite phosphorus showed an exponential reduction in hydrochar with increasing reaction severity, together with the decrease of orthophosphate in liquid phase. As for heavy metals, hydrothermal carbonization promoted decrease in direct bioavailable fractions (except arsenic) and increase in stable fraction (except cadmium and arsenic) in hydrochar as reaction severity elevated. Since hydrothermal effects led to redistribution of nutrients speciation and immobilization of heavy metals, non-farm land application of both hydrochar and liquid phase seems to be possible and unrestricted. This study provides fundamental knowledges for the construction of sludge management strategies to better nutrients recycling and reclamation.},

The maximal adsorption capacity of the prepared adsorbent was estimated to be 22 mg-P/g, and the adsorption performance remained stable in the pH range of 5–8. FeO(OH) was identified as the key adsorption site, and the ligand exchange mediated chemical adsorption was the main mechanism for phosphorus removal by the prepared material. Moreover, a laboratory-scale continuous-flow adsorption column experiment showed that the surplus phosphorus in secondary effluent could be readily reduced to {\textless}0.1 mg/L. By pyrolysis of P-laden alkali-treated iron sludge under oxygen limited conditions, the phosphorus was recovered and successfully applied to support wheat growth.

Our purpose was to identify mechanisms of P capture in biochar and thereby inform its future optimisation as a sustainable P fertiliser. The biochar feedstock comprised pellets of anaerobically digested sewage sludge (PAD) or pellets of the same blended in the ratio 9:1 with ochre sourced from minewater treatment (POCAD), components which have limited alternative economic value. In the present study the feedstocks were pyrolysed at two highest treatment temperatures of 450 and 550 °C. Each of the resulting biochars were repeatedly exposed to a 20 mg l−1 PO4-P solution, to produce a parallel set of P-exposed biochars. Biochar exterior and/or interior surfaces were quantitatively characterised using laser-ablation (LA)-ICP-MS, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray. The results highlighted the general importance of Fe minerals in P capture. XPS analysis of POCAD550 indicated lower oxidation state Fe2p3 bonding compared to POCAD450, and LA-ICP-MS indicated stronger covariation of Fe and S, even after P exposure. This suggests that low-solubility Fe/S compounds are formed during pyrolysis, are affected by process parameters and impact on P capture. Other data suggested capture roles for aluminium, calcium and silicon. Overall, our analyses suggest that a range of mechanisms for P capture are concurrently active in biochar. We highlighted the potential to manipulate these through choice of form and composition of feedstock as well as pyrolysis processing, so that biochar may be increasingly tailored towards specific functionality.},

Results of carbon content and elemental composition suggested that the hydrochars might not be comparable with pyrochars regarding to the carbon sequestration, long-term stability and fuel quality. Application as soil amendment would be a better approach for hydrochar utilization. To examine the potential benefits and risks of that, the total and available content of nutrients (i.e. N, P, and K) were measured, and the potentially toxic elements (PTEs, i.e. Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cd) were analyzed for the total content, speciation, and leaching potential. Compared with pyrochars derived from the same feedstock, hydrochars had lower pH and higher cation exchange capacity. The available content of N (1.58–6.87 g/kg), P (0.270–0.901 g/kg), and K (0–0.873 g/kg) in the chars was less than the feedstock sludge (3.33 g/kg N, 3.02 g/kg P, 2.07 g/kg K), but still far higher than that of the agricultural soil (i.e. 0.014–0.488 g/kg N, 0.02 g/kg P, {\textless}0.1–0.272 g/kg). Remarkably, hydrochars showed better nutritional balance than pyrochars for its higher available K content. Risk of potentially toxic elements contamination by the sludge was efficiently reduced in either hydrochars or pyrochars, except the high leaching potential of Zn in pyrochars. Overall, in addition to the advantages of the hydrothermal carbonization process as energy saving and value-added liquid by-products, the hydrochars derived from sludge, with sufficient and balanced nutrients and limited PTEs pollution risk, can be a feasible and value-added material as soil amendment.},

In this study novel biochar materials for P filtration of wastewater were designed and produced using waste feedstocks, with consideration of the plant accessibility of the P captured by the biochars. The biochars were produced using batch slow pyrolysis at 450 °C and 550 °C from a) AD: anaerobically digested sewage sludge and b) OCAD: a 1:1 mixture of anaerobically digested sewage sludge and ochre, a mineral product from mine drainage treatment. A set of experiments was designed using pH buffering to provide a robust framework for assessing the P recovery capacity and affinity of the biochars compared to other potential P recovery materials (unprocessed ochre, activated carbon and zeolite). After 5 days of repeated exposure to a P solution at a wastewater-relevant concentration (0.02 g P l-1) replenished each 24 h, relatively high masses of P were recovered by ochre (1.73 ± 8.93×10-3 mg P g-1) and the biochars OCAD550 (1.26 ± 4.66×10-3 mg P g-1), OCAD450 (1.24 ± 2.10×10-3 mg P g-1), AD450 (1.06 ± 3.84×10-3 mg P g-1), and AD550 (0.986 ± 9.31×10-3 mg P g-1). The biochar materials had higher removal rates than both activated carbon (0.884 ± 1.69×10-2 mg P g-1) and zeolite (0.130 ± 1.05×10-2 mg P g-1). To assess the extractability of recovered P, P exposure was followed by repeated extraction for 4 days with pH 7-buffered deionised water. The AD biochars retained 55\% of the P recovered, OCAD biochars 78\% and ochre 100\%. Assessment of potentially toxic element concentrations in the biochars against guideline values indicated low risk associated with their use in the environment. Our successful demonstration of biochar materials highlights the potential for further development of P filters for wastewater treatment systems from anaerobic digestate produced and pyrolysed on-site with energy recovery.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) in animal manures is an important P pool for P recycling and reclamation. In recent years, thermochemical techniques have gained much interests for effective waste treatment and P recycling. This study comparatively characterized the transformation of P during two representative thermochemical treatments (pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization, HTC) of four animal manures (swine, chicken, beef, and dairy manures) by combining nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and sequential extraction. For both pyrolysis and HTC treatments, degradation of organic phosphate and crystallization of Ca phosphate minerals were observed and were highly dependent on treatment temperature. Extensive crystallization of Ca phosphate minerals occurred at temperatures above 450 °C during pyrolysis, compared to the lower temperature (175 and 225 °C) requirements during HTC. As a result, P was immobilized in the hydrochars and high temperature pyrochars, and was extracted primarily by HCl. Because Ca is the dominating P-complexing cation in all four manures, all manures showed similar P speciation and transformation behaviors during the treatments. Results from this work provided deeper insights into the thermochemical processes occurred during the pyrolysis and HTC treatments of biological wastes, as well as guidance for P reclamation and recycling from these wastes.},

Influence of pyrolysis conditions (temperature, heating rate and residence time) on physico-chemical properties of biosolids (collected at Mount Martha Water Recycling Plant, Melbourne), phosphorus fractions and phosphorus forms was investigated. Twelve different biochar samples were produced at 400, 500 and 600 °C, at two heating rates (5 and 20 °C/min) and at two residence times (30 and 120 min). Biochar yield, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), elements (C, H and N) and BET surface area were analysed. Sequential extraction of P in biosolids and resultant biochars was done using Hedley method. Characterization was completed with SEM images and results from 31P liquid state NMR. Increased temperatures would not only increase the alkalinity, decrease EC and increase the adsorption capacity by increasing the surface area but also convert the readily available P to a less available pool. Therefore, this nutrient might be released to soil slowly over a longer period of time. The results showed that temperature, along with residence time and heating rate, had a significant effect on the characteristics observed. Therefore, all these factors need to be carefully considered when preparing biochar for use as a soil amendment.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge is necessary to promote the sustainable recovery of agricultural fertilizer products and prevent the negative environmental problems. In this study, an innovation procedure of FeCl 3-assisted sewage sludge hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) treatment for selective elution of apatite phosphorus (AP) has been developed to recover phosphorus as K-struvite. AP of above 88\% was eluted from the sludge solid phase at pH of 2.5, and the dissolved phosphate from AP was mainly fixed by FeCl 3. The transformation of phosphorus fractions under different HTC temperature (200-260 ℃) and time (0.5-4 h) with or without FeCl 3 were subsequently investigated. Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P NMR) results showed that prolonging HTC time and increasing HTC temperature could disintegrate organic phosphorus (OP), while higher HTC temperature was effective for decomposition of pyrophosphate (Pyro-P). The content of or-thophosphate (Ortho-P) in hydrochar accounted for above 95\% of total phosphorus (TP) under HTC temperature of 200 ℃ for 4 h with FeCl 3. The phosphate desorption behavior of hydrochar with FeCl 3 treated was well described by Pseudo-second-order kinetic model, while the hydrochar without FeCl 3 treated followed Pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic models. About 96.1\% of phosphate was extracted from the hydrochar under pH of 12.0 and contact time of 120 min. Finally, about 92.6\% of TP in sewage sludge was recovered as K-struvite to alleviate the depletion of phosphorus resource.},

	abstract = {• A novel hydrothermal humification (HTH) was used for the treatment of wastewater sludge. • HTH allowed the recycling of sludge with close-to-complete recovery of the valuable phosphate. • HTH effectively reduced the environmental risk of heavy metals from sludge. • Ternary biomass added to sludge change the extraction efficiency of P and K. • The optimized process is an "all-waste-strategy" route for sludge va-lorization. A B S T R A C T This publication presents a simple and low-cost hydrothermal humification (HTH) treatment of sewage sludge (SS) together with alkali ash (AA) and biomass for simultaneous implementation of heavy metal removal, nutrient recovery (P) and ash refining. The H/C and O/C atomic ratio plots obtained from elemental analysis demonstrate that dehydration and decarboxylation under hydrothermal conditions are elemental reactions leading to sludge/biomass decomposition and artificial humic matter formation. Introduction of plant biomass into sludge-derived samples and adjustment of KOH or alkali ash (AA) mass effectively improve the recovery of P element, realizing high contents of dissolved phosphorus (DP) (from 7045 to 10075 mg/L) at appropriate pH values (6.5 to 7.7). ICP-AES results indicate the drop of Cr and Cd content below detection limit together with a sharp decrease of the elements Cu (from 0.07 to 0.46 mg/g), Zn (from 0.15 to 0.98 mg/g) and Pb (from 0.067 to 0.142 mg/g) after HTH treatment in sludge-derived liquid products and the heavy metal elements enriched in sludge-derived solids can be recovered into industrial salts by subsequent treatment. Pot planting experiments are conducted to investigate the P-availability in both sludge-derived liquids and solids (after treatment of heavy metal recovery) for promotion of plant growth. A higher proportion of shoot-to-root weight (62.1\% versus 46.2\%) and preserved moisture contents (84.7\% versus 83.7\%) when compared to the control groups demonstrate the effect of the presence of more nutrients after addition of sludge-derived liquid products. This work could provide a smart, energy utilization and sustainable fertilization route for planting growth.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge contains high content of phosphorus and represents an important secondary phosphorus source. Meanwhile, chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an innovative sludge treatment technology with low NO emission and potential to effectively recover phosphorus. A full understanding of the phosphorus transformation mechanism is vital for the development of CLC of sewage sludge. In this work, the release and transformation behavior of phosphorus in CLC of sewage sludge was studied in a batch fluidized bed reactor with hematite oxygen carrier. The increase of fuel reactor temperature had a marginal influence on phosphorus transformation. Approximately 66.81–69.30\% of phosphorus in sewage sludge was concentrated in fly ash during CLC of sewage sludge. The fraction of phosphorus in flue gas was relatively constant, since nearly all of the organic phosphorus volatized. Moreover, the available phosphorus in sludge CLC fly ash was vastly superior to that in sludge combustion ash. The higher available phosphorus content could fulfill the quality parameters for a P-fertilizer. Considering the effect of phosphorus on the reactivity of hematite, the promotion by phosphorus catalyzing and weaken by deposition appeared to be in competition with each other. The reduction reactivity of hematite increased at lower phosphorus content, but it decreased at higher phosphorus content ({\textgreater}3\%). Regarding the effect of sludge ash on hematite, the reactivity of hematite increased by adding proper content of sludge ash. Simultaneously, the reactivity of sludge ash as oxygen carrier in reducing period was tested. Despite the fact that sludge ash contained high fractions of Fe and Ca, the performance of sludge ash was unstable in CLC process. This indicated that it was infeasible of using sludge ash as oxygen carrier.},

The knowledge of the bioavailable forms of phosphorus is important not only for sediments but also for sludge and soils.

A lot of past research has addressed nutrients releases from conventional biological processes. Nutrients removal is more challenging for highly loaded industrial wastewaters. ANAMMOX for nutrient removal is efficient over conventional method. a b s t r a c t Water scarcity and its pollution has become a concern in recent times. The disposal of nutrient-rich (nitrogen and phosphorous) wastewater is also one of the main cause of water pollution through eutrophication, reduced dissolved oxygen that poses threat to aquatic ecosystems. As a result, nutrient removal has become a mandate apart from the removal of organics. However, the removal of nutrients from sewage is a challenging task. Conversely, conventional biological treatment processes provide little relief in nutrient removal. The treated effluents from conventional biological processes do not achieve the stringent nutrient removal disposal standard limits and become primary cause of pollution in the receiving water bodies. This has stressed upon the need for eco-friendly, low-energy and cost-efficient nutrient removal treatment technologies. Various biological treatment combinations or variants are in use for the efficient removal of nutrients. The biological processes in itself or in combination with chemical processes are preferred over technologies based solely on physico-chemical processes for its treatment performance at lower cost. This review summarizes the existing treatment processes and their possible up-gradation with the aim to accomplish the marked effluent standards for the nutrients. The concept of conventional systems and advanced systems for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) removal which are already developed or under development are deeply discussed. Further, the challenges of each treatment systems are abridged. Finally, the possible suggestions for the modification/ retrofitting of existing treatment systems for achieving stringent disposal standards are pointed out.},

	abstract = {Minable phosphorus (P) reserves are being depleted and will need to be replaced by recovering P that currently is lost from the agricultural system, causing water-quality problems. The largest two flows of lost P are in agricultural runoff and erosion (\$46\% of mined P globally) and animal wastes (\$40\%). These flows are quite distinct. Runoff has a very high volumetric flow rate, but a low P concentration; animal wastes have low flow rates, but a high P concentration together with a high concentration of organic material. Recovering the lost P in animal wastes is technically and economically more tractable, and it is the focus for this review of promising P-capture technologies. P capture requires that organic P be transformed into inorganic P (phosphate). For high-strength animal wastes, P release can be accomplished in tandem with anaerobic treatment that converts the energy value in the organic matter to CH 4 , H 2 , or electricity. Once present as phosphate, the P can be captured in a reusable form by four approaches. Most well developed is precipitation as magnesium or calcium solids. Less developed, but promising are adsorption to iron-based adsorbents, ion exchange to phosphate-selective solids, and uptake by photosynthetic microorganisms or P-selective proteins.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a critical, geographically concentrated, nonrenewable resource necessary to support global food production. In excess (e.g., due to runoff or wastewater discharges), P is also a primary cause of eutrophication. To reconcile the simultaneous shortage and overabundance of P, lost P flows must be recovered and reused, alongside improvements in P-use efficiency. While this motivation is increasingly being recognized, little P recovery is practiced today, as recovered P generally cannot compete with the relatively low cost of mined P. Therefore, P is often captured to prevent its release into the environment without beneficial recovery and reuse. However, additional incentives for P recovery emerge when accounting for the total value of P recovery. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the range of benefits of recovering P from waste streams, i.e., the total value of recovering P. This approach accounts for P products, as well as other assets that are associated with P and can be recovered in parallel, such as energy, nitrogen, metals and minerals, and water. Additionally, P recovery provides valuable services to society and the environment by protecting and improving environmental quality, enhancing efficiency of waste treatment facilities, and improving food security and social equity. The needs to make P recovery a reality are also discussed, including business models, bottlenecks, and policy and education strategies.},

In addition, NMR can provide physical information (rigidity, dynamics, etc.) as well as permit in depth quantification. Hyphenation with other techniques such as liquid chromatography, solid phase extraction and mass spectrometry creates unprecedented capabilities for the identification of novel and unknown chemical species. Thus, NMR is widely used in the study of different components of wastewater, such as complex organic matter (fulvic and humic acids), sludge and wastewater.

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable resource, and its recovery and recycling are necessary for meeting future P demands and environmental conservation. Ash and hydrochar from incineration and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of municipal sludge, respectively, represent promising sources for efficient P recovery. The full-scale application of wet-chemical techniques has proven their technical feasibility for P recovery from sludge-derived ash. HTL for sludge treatment has received significant attention for producing biocrude with net-positive energy recovery. P recovery from the solid by-product of sludge HTL, hydrochar, is a critical step in holistic sustainable sludge management. This review aims to guide P recovery from sludge-derived ash and hydrochar by presenting recent advances in wet-chemical extraction and precipitation. By comparing their characteristics, ash and hydrochar derived from municipal sludge exhibit similar feasibilities and challenges for P recovery. Extraction is recognized as the critical step for P recovery. The advantages and disadvantages of various P extraction approaches are provided. Acidic extraction achieves high efficiency (up to 100\%) but requires removal of co-extracted heavy metals. Alkaline extraction prevents metals contamination but shows low efficiency ({\textless}70\%). Sequential extraction is first identified as an important advance in this review, with promising P extraction efficiencies (70–91\%) and low metal interferences. Three possible fertilizers (struvite, calcium phosphates, and vivianite) are recommended through the final precipitation, given their pros and cons of recovery. Ultimately, this review highlights the need for a wastewater biorefinery integrating wastewater treatment, HTL (energy recovery), and nutrient recovery for sustainable sludge management.},

	abstract = {The abatement of nutrient compounds from aqueous waste and wastewater is currently a priority issue. Indeed, the uncontrolled discharge of high levels of nutrients into water bodies causes serious deteriorations of environmental quality. On the other hand, the increasing request of nutrient compounds for agronomic utilizations makes it strictly necessary to identify technologies able to recover the nutrients from wastewater streams so as to avoid the consumption of natural resources. In this regard, the removal and recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from aqueous waste and wastewater as struvite (MgNH4PO4·6H2O) represents an attractive approach. Indeed, through the struvite precipitation it is possible to effectively remove the ammonium and phosphate content of many types of wastewater and to produce a solid compound, with only a trace of impurities. This precipitate, due to its chemical characteristics, represents a valuable multi-nutrients slow release fertilizer for vegetables and plants growth. For these reasons, the struvite precipitation technology constantly progresses on several aspects of the process. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review on the recent developments in this technology for the removal and recovery of nutrients from aqueous waste and wastewater. The theoretical background, the parameters, and the operating conditions affecting the process evolution are initially presented. After that, the paper focuses on the reagents exploitable to promote the process performance, with particular regard to unconventional low-cost compounds. In addition, the development of reactors configurations, the main technologies implemented on field scale, as well as the recent works on the use of struvite in agronomic practices are presented.},

This will enable the reduction of eutrophication of surface waters due to the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus, originating from agricultural fields fertilizers. The use of biological waste is a practical solution to recover valuable fertilizer components.

	abstract = {Recovering resources from wastewater systems is increasingly being emphasised. Many technologies exist or are under development for recycling nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater to agriculture. Planning and design methodologies are needed to identify and deploy the most sustainable solutions in given contexts. For the environmental sustainability dimension, life cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to assess environmental impact potentials of wastewater-based nutrient recycling alternatives, especially nitrogen and phosphorus recycling. This review aims to evaluate how well the LCA methodology has been adapted and applied for assessing opportunities of wastewater-based nutrient recycling in the form of monomineral, multimineral, nutrient solution and organic solid. We reviewed 65 LCA studies that considered nutrient recycling from wastewater for agricultural land application. We synthesised some of their insights and methodological practices, and discussed the future outlook of using LCA for wastewater-based nutrient recycling. In general, more studies suggested positive environmental outcomes from wastewater-based nutrient recycling, especially when chemical inputs are minimised, and source separation of human excreta is achieved. The review shows the need to improve methodological consistency (e.g., multifunctionality, fertiliser offset accounting, contaminant accounting), ensure transparency of inventory and methods, consider uncertainty in comparative LCA context, integrate up-to-date cross-disciplinary knowledge (e.g., agriculture science, soil science) into LCA models, and consider the localised impacts of recycled nutrient products. Many opportunities exist for applying LCA at various scales to support decisions on wastewater-based nutrient recycling – for instance, performing “product perspective” LCA on recycled nutrient products, integrating “process perspective” LCA with other systems approaches for selecting and optimising individual recovery processes, assessing emerging nutrient recovery technologies and integrated resource recovery systems, and conducting systems analysis at city, national and global level.},

	abstract = {The addition of iron is a convenient way for removing phosphorus from wastewater, but this is often considered to limit phosphorus recovery. Struvite precipitation is currently used to recover phosphorus, and this approach has attracted much interest. However, it requires the use of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). EBPR is not yet widely applied and the recovery potential is low. Other phosphorus recovery methods, including sludge application to agricultural land or recovering phosphorus from sludge ash, also have limitations. Energy-producing wastewater treatment plants increasingly rely on phosphorus removal using iron, but the problem (as in current processes) is the subsequent recovery of phosphorus from the iron. In contrast, phosphorus is efficiently mobilized from iron by natural processes in sediments and soils. Iron-phosphorus chemistry is diverse, and many parameters influence the binding and release of phosphorus, including redox conditions, pH, presence of organic substances, and particle morphology. We suggest that the current poor understanding of iron and phosphorus chemistry in wastewater systems is preventing processes being developed to recover phosphorus from iron-phosphorus rich wastes like municipal wastewater sludge. Parameters that affect phosphorus recovery are reviewed here, and methods are suggested for manipulating iron-phosphorus chemistry in wastewater treatment processes to allow phosphorus to be recovered.},

A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Vivianite Solubility product Crystallization Metastable zone Phosphate recovery Sewage treatment A B S T R A C T Vivianite mediating phosphate immobilization has been widely reported in natural environments and could be a promising measure for phosphorus recovery from sewage. This paper investigated the compatibility of vivianite crystallization in anaerobic sludge digesters at sewage treatment plants (STPs), where P in the sewage is concentrated , from a thermodynamic perspective and the effect of pH as a major influencing factor was studied. Vivianite crystallization under different conditions was performed by batch assays and in a continuous reactor as well. Chemical equilibriums and specification were evaluated by a MINTEQ 3.0 package, and the reaction products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, microscopy and a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The results show that the pKsp of vivianite was 39.8-40.7 at temperatures from 25 to 55 °C, and the temperature effect was insignificant. The metastable zone for vivianite was SI (supersaturated index) 0-11, but crystallization was greatly enhanced when SI was higher than 4. Effective crystallization of vivianite was observed at pH 7; the SI level at pH 6 was insufficient to trigger crystal nucleation and at pH 8 simple precipitation became dominant rather than crystallization. Adding quartz grains as seeds promoted vivianite crystallization by accelerating the reactions and lowering the supersaturation demand. In summary, this study demonstrated that vivianite pathway of phosphate recovery was thermodynamically compatible with P-rich anaerobic digestion systems. Because the forms of both phosphate and Fe(II) ions are pH-dependent, vivianite crystallization can be de-terminatively affected by the pH level of the system. Apparently, other physico-chemical and microbiological conditions, e.g., suspended solids, would also influence vivianite formation in the complex sludge mixture and warrants more research for process optimization.},

	abstract = {Phosphate recovery from sewage sludge is essential in a circular economy. Currently, the main focus in centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) lies on struvite recovery routes, land application of sludge or on technologies that rely on sludge incineration. These routes have several disadvantages. Our study shows that the mineral vivianite, Fe 2 (PO 4) 3 Â 8H 2 O, is present in digested sludge and can be the major form of phosphate in the sludge. Thus, we suggest vivianite can be the nucleus for alternative phosphate recovery options. Excess and digested sewage sludge was sampled from full-scale MWTPs and analysed using x-ray diffraction (XRD), conventional scanning electron mi-croscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), environmental SEM-EDX (eSEM-EDX) and M€ ossbauer spectroscopy. Vivianite was observed in all plants where iron was used for phosphate removal. In excess sludge before the anaerobic digestion, ferrous iron dominated the iron pool (!50\%) as shown by M€ ossbauer spectroscopy. XRD and M€ ossbauer spectroscopy showed no clear correlation between vivianite bound phosphate versus the iron content in excess sludge. In digested sludge, ferrous iron was the dominant iron form ({\textgreater}85\%). Phosphate bound in vivianite increased with the iron content of the digested sludge but levelled off at high iron levels. 70e90\% of all phosphate was bound in vivianite in the sludge with the highest iron content (molar Fe:P ¼ 2.5). The quantification of vivianite was difficult and bears some uncertainty probably because of the presence of impure vivianite as indicated by SEM-EDX. eSEM-EDX indicates that the vivianite occurs as relatively small (20e100 mm) but free particles. We envisage very efficient phosphate recovery technologies that separate these particles based on their magnetic properties from the complex sludge matrix.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus deposits around the world are rapidly depleting, therefore phosphorus recovery methods are gaining more and more interest both in science and industry. This article presents the main methods of phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge. The described approaches are divided in two groups: phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge and leachate, and recovery of phosphorus from sewage sludge ashes. The latter seems to have more advantages connected with both ecological and economical aspects. The need for development of "no solid waste generation" strategy is becoming more and more urgent. The concept of comprehensive management of all solid residues after what is currently considered the most ecological process of sewage sludge incineration connected with phosphorus recovery based on acidic extraction, is described in the article. Solid residues after phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge ashes by means of acidic extraction can be stabilized with solid residues after sewage sludge incineration exhaust gas treatment. Such an approach may enable production of phosphoric raw material together with stabilized construction material. Advantages and disadvantages of the discussed approaches are given. An analysis of the composition of ashes produced in different sewage sludge treatment plants indicates that the proposed technology could be successfully applied in most of such units, especially because the concentrations of elements such as K, Mg, Na, P are sufficiently high, respectively 1.5e12.1 g/ kg; 9.9e14.9 g/kg; 3.6e13,3 g/kg and 27,4e99,0 g/kg. However, a phosphorus recovery method should be developed separately for each treatment plant. Only then all comprehensive management methods will be ecologically and economically justified. Analytical methods which could be of use at every step of designing a proper phosphorus recovery process are described.},

The aim of this study was to optimize a leaching process to recover P-leachate with high purity for P fertilizer production. The results show that both organic and inorganic acids extract P-containing phases but organic acids leach more trace elements, particularly Cu, Zn, Pb and As. Sulphuric acid was the most efficient for P recovery and achieved 94\% of total extraction under the optimal conditions, which were 2-h reaction with 0.2 mol/L H2SO4 at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 20:1. EDTA extracted only 20\% of the available P, but the leachates were contaminated with high levels of trace elements under optimum conditions (3-h reaction with EDTA at 0.02 mol/L, pH 2, and liquid-to-solid ratio of 20:1). Therefore, EDTA was considered an appropriate pre-treatment agent for reducing the total metal/metalloid content in ISSA, which produced negligible changes in the structure of ISSA and reduced contamination during subsequent P extraction using sulphuric acid.},

To fully utilize LTCA as a fertilizer, this study investigated a procedure for P recovery from LTCA via struvite crystallization with fewer impurities. The adsorption characteristics of P and Fe by cation exchange resin (CER) were explored by simulating using the macroscopic parametric equation Thomas model. Optimum purification conditions for P-rich leachate by cation exchange column method were determined. Results showed that approximately 97.21 wt\% of P was extracted from LTCA at HCl concentration of 0.8 M and liquid/solid ratio of 20.0 ml/g. More than 90 wt\% of impurities could be detached by making P-rich leachate flow through cation exchange bed filled by CER at 300 ml/h. The macroscopic parametric equation Thomas model could clearly describe the adsorption characteristics of Fe in P-rich leachate by CER. Theoretical basis for purification of high concentration Fe in P-rich leachate by CER was provided. Approximately 84.04 wt\% of total P in LTCA was recovered as struvite crystal which had low concentrations of heavy metals (5.96 mg/kg for Cr, 45.21 mg/kg for Cu, 29.67 mg/kg for Ni, 2.24 mg/kg for Pb, and 290.6 mg/kg for Zn) and could be eco-friendly for agricultural application.

Another major difference between the ashes was that flue gas purification products were mixed into the first ash and it contained about 5\% activated carbon. The Al rich ash had a significantly higher buffering capacity and required more acid for extraction of P. When acid extraction of P from ISSA is the method for recovery, it is thus beneficial to go back to the waste water treatment facility and e.g. choose Fe for P precipitation rather than Al. Formation of a high amount of gypsum crystals in both ashes after extraction in H2SO4 was seen by SEM-EDX. H2SO4 is the cheapest mineral ash, but the gypsum formation must be taken into account when either finding possibility for using the remaining ash in e.g. construction materials or if the choice is deposition, as the gypsum increases the volume significantly. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Wet chemical approach is widely applied for P extraction from incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA)due to the relatively simple process and low lost. In this study, H2SO4 and H2C2O4 were compared to recover P from ISSA through three steps of acid leaching, cation exchange resin (CER)purification and precipitation. Transformations of P speciation and mineral phases in ISSA from 600 to 900 °C were studied. The results showed that the ISSA samples were mainly composed of inorganic P (IP), and part of non-apatite IP (NAIP, mainly AlPO4)would transform to apatite P (AP, Ca3(PO4)2)with the increase in temperature. The ratio of NAIP to IP dropped from 71.9\% at 600 °C to 53.7\% at 900 °C. Effect of acid concentration on the leaching efficiency of P from the ISSA samples incinerated at different temperatures by H2SO4 and H2C2O4 was investigated, and the leaching behaviors of key elements of P, Ca, Al and Fe were compared. H2C2O4 exhibited a better performance than H2SO4 for the leaching efficiency of P. Severe sintering of ash particles occurred at temperature {\textgreater}800 °C inhibited the P leaching by H2SO4. During CER purification, the impurity elements in the H2SO4 leachate were easily removed by CER, whereas the Al and Fe elements in the H2C2O4 leachate were hardly removed due to the formation of anionic complexes between Al3+/Fe3+ and oxalic ions. Finally, high-purity struvite product was synthesized from the purified H2SO4 leachate, which could be directly utilized as a fertilizer with negligible environmental risk. Amorphous aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates were obtained from the H2C2O4 leachate. This study provides insights for P recovery from ISSA samples by different acid leaching systems.},

	abstract = {The presence of heavy metals in concentrations above legal limit values is one of the main obstacles preventing closure of the phosphorus (P) cycle through directly applying wastewater treatment sludge ash as a fertilizer. Therefore, an alternative procedure is proposed to recover the valuable P from the sludge ash via wet chemical extraction. This comprehensive study uses several inorganic and organic acids, chelating agents and an alkaline solution to establish optimal and cost-effective conditions for wet P extraction from sludge ash. The optimization takes into account co-extraction of the following heavy metals: Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Design of experiments results show extraction liquid concentration, liquid/solid ratio and contact time all affect P and heavy metal extraction efficiency, both individually and through interaction. In addition, type of extraction liquid and pH at the end of the extraction procedure also affect P and heavy metal extraction efficiency. Combining results of XRD and SEM-EDX analysis with extraction data shows that at a pH {\textless}2, both Ca- and Al-phosphates in the ash dissolve easily. However, at slightly higher pH only Ca-phosphates dissolve well and at alkaline pH only Al-phosphates. The best trade-off between high P extraction, low heavy metal co-extraction and low operational costs is obtained with H2SO4 (0.5 N, 10 ml/g, 120 min) and oxalic acid (0.5 N, 12.8 ml/g, 120 min). H2SO4 outperforms the other extraction liquids in terms of extraction liquid costs per kg P extracted, whereas extraction with oxalic acid results in the lowest heavy metal co-extraction, thus reducing the downstream processing costs. None of the extraction liquids considered is appropriate for heavy metal removal prior to P extraction due to loss of P and insufficient heavy metal removal.},

	abstract = {The advantages and drawbacks of existing wet chemical phosphorus (P) recovery technologies, their applicability to different types of sewage sludge ash (SSA) and the role of the decay products of detergent zeolites as a source of reactive Al in SSA are analyzed. Since neither a purely acidic nor a purely alkaline treatment are able to provide satisfactory technical solutions a wet chemical phosphorus (P) recovery process for sewage sludge ashes (SSAs) is investigated in detail that is based on a sequential treatment of SSA with an acid and a base. As a result of an acidic pre-treatment, the P fraction of the raw SSA that was bound as - alkaline-insoluble - calcium phosphate (Ca-P) is converted into aluminum phosphate (Al-P). This newly formed Al-P can be easily dissolved via alkaline treatment and then easily separated from the alkaline leachate via precipitation of Ca-P. The Al-component can be reused as precipitant for P-removal in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). The investigated process requires fewer chemicals than the direct acidic dissolution of all P-compounds contained in the SSA. This is due to the described rearrangement of the P component from Ca-P to Al-P. That such a rearrangement of P occurs indeed was confirmed through a combination of XRD, ICP and XRF analyses together with mass balance calculations. The present investigation proves that the process works for very different types of SSAs: For Al-rich SSAs that come from WWTPs where Al-salt is used for chemical P-removal the described sequential treatment process works best and yields P-recovery rates as high as 70-77\%. But even for SSAs from WWTPs where only iron salt is used for chemical P-removal, a considerable amount of the reactive Al necessary for the described P-rearrangement is supplied by decay products of detergent zeolites, a hidden Al-source present in most SSAs produced in Europe. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results indicated that, compared with SS pyrolysis alone, co-pyrolysis of SS with various OFMSW (except PVC) lead to lower biochar yields but with higher pH values (increased between 21.80\% and 31.70\%) and carbon contents (raised between 33.45\% and 48.22\%) in blended biochars, and the chemical speciation analysis suggested that co-pyrolysis further promoted the HMs transformation into more stable forms which significantly reduce the associated environmental risk of HMs in the blended biochars (the values of RI lower than 55.80). The addition of PVC, however, impeded biochar properties and compromised HMs immobilization during SS pyrolysis.},

The P speciation in four SSAs was characterized before and after the removal of heavy metals by a thermo-chemical treatment that involved CaCl2 addition. We chose complementary techniques to determine the direct P speciation, including X-ray powder diffraction, solid-state 31P direct-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption near edge structure. Results from these techniques were compared with operational and functional speciation information obtained from a sequential P extraction and a plant biotest with Italian ryegrass grown on a soil-sand mixture with little available P. The speciation of P in untreated and thermo-chemically treated SSAs depended on their elemental composition. At a molar ratio of Ca:P ≤ 2, SSAs contained combinations of polymorphs of AlPO4, β-tricalcium phosphate, and apatite-like P species. In SSAs with a molar ratio of Ca:P {\textgreater} 2, an apatite-like molecular environment was predominant. The thermo-chemical process induced an increase in crystalline phases and enhanced the crystallinity of the P species. The structural order of the bulk sample was the most decisive parameter in controlling the P availability of the studied SSAs to plants. We conclude that, to produce a high-quality fertilizer and despite of the successful heavy metal removal, the thermo-chemical process requires further development toward enhanced P bioavailability. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.},

The shift from this traditional method to newer and more sophisticated analytical methods such as inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectroscopy for P determination in soil extract could have serious implications on agronomic and environmental P management. Thus, the objectives of this study were to compare P determination by colorimetric and ICP methods in four extractants, namely Olsen, Mehlich 3, CaCl2, and water extraction methods and to evaluate the possibility of developing conversion equations for P determination for the two methods in Manitoba soils. A laboratory experiment was conducted to establish relationships between P determination by colorimetric and ICP methods. Sixty surface soil samples (30 manured and 30 nonmanured) were collected from across Manitoba and extracted with Mehlich 3 reagent, Olsen solution, calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution, and deionized water. Extractable P in the extract was determined by colorimetric (Col-P) and ICP (ICP-P) methods. The concentrations of P measured by the two methods were statistically analyzed. Mean comparison showed that P amounts determined by ICP in Mehlich 3, water, and CaCl2 solutions were significantly greater than those determined by colorimetric method (P {\textless} 0.05) in the study. The differences between P determinations by the two analytical methods in the extractants were probably due to the presence of organic P, which was included in ICP determination but not in colorimetric determination. The influence of other factors such as the presence of colloidal particles on the P that was determined by the two methods could not be ruled out. However, Olsen P determined by the colorimetric method was not significantly different from the values determined by ICP (P {\textgreater} 0.05) probably because the alkaline nature of this extractant enhanced the hydrolysis of organic P in the extract, thus including organic P in the colorimetric determination of P. There were significant correlations between the two methods of P determination in the various extracting solutions with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.94 and 1.00. The two methods of P determination were linearly related for all the extracting solutions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The interest of using biochar, the solid byproduct from organic waste pyrolysis, as soil conditioner is significantly increasing. Nevertheless, persistent organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are formed during pyrolysis due to the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Consequently, these pollutants may enter the environment when biochar is incorporated into soil and cause adverse ecological effects. In this study, we examined the content of the 16 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) PAHs in biochars produced from rice husk, wood, wheat and sewage sludge residues using three different pyrolytic reactors and temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C). The total concentration of PAHs (∑PAH) ranged from 799 to 6364 μg kg −1 , being naphthalene, phenanthrene and anthracene the most abundant PAHs in all the biochars. The maximum amount of PAHs was observed for the rice husk biochar produced in the batch reactor at 400 °C, which decreased with increasing temperature. The ∑PAH value of the wood biochar produced via traditional kilns doubled compared with the wood biochar produced using the other pyrolytic reactors (5330 μg kg −1 in Kiln; 2737 μg kg −1 in batch and 1942 μg kg −1 in the rotary reactor). Looking for a more reliable risk assessment of the potential exposure of PAHs in biochar, the total toxic equivalent concentrations (TTEC) of the 14 produced biochars were calculated. When comparing the same feedstock and temperature, TTEC values indicated that the rotary reactor produced the safest biochars. In contrast, the biochars produced using the batch reactor at 400 and 500 °C have the greatest hazard potential. Our results provide valuable information on the potential risk of biochar application for human and animal health, as well as for the environment due to PAHs contamination.},

Sewage sludge (SSL) is an adequate secondary P-resource for P-fertilizer production but it is also a sink for heavy metals and organic pollutants. The present study is an investigation on thermochemical P-recycling of SSL. Various temperatures and amendments were tested regarding their performance to remove heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and simultaneous increase of the plant-availability of P. The investigations were carried out on two types of SSL originating from wastewater treatment plants with chemical P-precipitation and enhanced biological P-removal, respectively. The results show that thermochemical treatment with chlorine donors is suitable to remove the majority of heavy metals and that a combination of a gaseous chlorine donor (HCl) and sodium additives leads to both high heavy metal removal and high plant availability of P. Furthermore, plant experiments show that almost all investigated thermochemical treatments can significantly reduce the bioavailability and plant uptake of heavy metals. Furthermore, PAHs are secondarily formed during low-temperature treatments (400–500 °C), but can be significantly reduced by using sodium carbonate as an additive.},

However, the knowledge regarding the leaching potentials and mechanisms of PAHs remains limited for biochar implementation to soil. In this study we evaluated the leaching behaviors of PAHs from sewage sludge-derived biochar pyrolyzed at different temperatures (300–700 °C) using the protocol of Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) with deionized water. Leachate concentrations of sixteen U.S. Environmental Protection Agency PAHs increased with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, exhibiting an opposite pyrolytic temperature dependence with their concentrations in biochar. The total leachate PAH concentration peaked at 700 °C with 11.75 μg/L, corresponding to 15.9\% of total PAHs present in biochar. PAH leaching was associated with the release of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) that created a mobile phase to facilitate the mobilization of PAHs into water. The enhanced release of calcium, aluminum, and barium from the biochars with pyrolysis temperature could also favor the leaching of biochar PAHs, due to the destruction of HOCs-(metal ions)-mineral linkages, which improved the release of HOCs and HOCs-bound PAHs; and because the extent of metal cross-linking in biochar is reduced, enabling better diffusion of PAHs through the inner matrix and thus accelerating their desorption.},

This exclusion of pyrolysis as a viable way to treat sewage sludge was mainly due to the lack of data on the fate of organic pollutants at pyrolysis conditions. In this work, we are addressing this knowledge gap. We studied slow pyrolysis as a potential process to efficiently treat organic pollutants present in stabilized sewage sludge. Sewage sludge was pyrolyzed in a quartz fixed bed reactor at temperatures of 400–800 °C for 2 h and the sludge and resulting sludge-chars were analyzed for the presence of four groups of organic pollutants, namely (i) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), (ii) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), (iii) pharmaceuticals, and (iv) endocrine-disrupting and hormonal compounds. Pyrolysis at ≥ 400 °C effectively removed pharmaceuticals (group iii) to below detection limits, whereas pyrolysis at temperatures higher than 600 °C was required to remove more than 99.8\% of the compounds from groups i, ii and iv. Based on these findings, we propose, that high temperature ({\textgreater}600 °C) slow pyrolysis can satisfactory remove organic pollutants from the resulting sludge-char, which could be safely applied as soil improver.},

Different thermal processes modify the feedstock's chemical and physical structure in differing ways, which also affects P speciation and plant availability in the residual ashes or carbonization products. This study assessed to which extent the P plant availability of ashes and chars produced from one batch of sewage sludge by incineration, pyrolysis or gasification was affected by particle size management and post-process oxidation. Overall, a smaller particle size of the materials as well as post-process oxidation of non-oxidized materials increased the amount of plant-available P in the soil. In a pot experiment, all the materials increased plant biomass compared with the untreated control, but the pyrolysis chars had a substantially greater fertiliser value than the gasification ashes, while the two tested incineration ashes differed in their P fertilizing effect. P availability in non-oxidized materials was partly related to lower process temperatures and lower levels of crystallinity. However, downstream oxidation simultaneously increased crystallinity and P availability in a pyrolysis char and gasification ashes, resulting in an increase in plant P uptake of up to 60\%. Results indicate that the oxidation of poorly soluble Fe-phosphates may contribute to the positive effect on P availability. The results suggest that changes to the design and settings of the thermal conversion processes of sewage sludge offer considerable potential for improving P availability in the residual material.},

Recent developments in the field of microbiology and research on the origin of life have suggested a possibly significant role for reduced, inorganic forms of phosphorus in bacterial metabolism and as evolutionary precursors of biological phosphate compounds. Reduced inorganic forms of phosphorus include phosphorus acid (H3PO3, P(+III)), hypophosphorus acid (H3PO2, P(+I)) and various forms of phosphides (P(-III)). Reduced phosphorus has been detected in anaerobic sediments, sewage treatment facilities and in industrial and agricultural processes. Microbiological evidence suggests a significant role for reduced phosphorus species in metabolic processes and raises interesting questions regarding the biogeochemistry of this nutrient in the environment. However, the paucity of data on the presence and cycling of reduced phosphorus compounds in the environment requires attention in order to elucidate the role of these compounds in natural systems.

	abstract = {Vivianite, Fe3(PO4)2 · 8 H2O, is a ferrous iron phosphate mineral which forms in waterlogged soils and sediments. The phosphorus (P) bound in its crystal lattice is considered to be immobilised because vivianite is stable under anoxic, reducing, sedimentary conditions. Thus, vivianite formation can make a major contribution to P retention during early diagenesis. Much remains unknown about vivianite in sediments, because technical challenges have rendered direct identification and quantification difficult. To identify vivianite and assess its significance for P burial during early diagenesis we studied the consequences of a 1992/1993 in-lake application of FeCl3 and Fe(OH)3 aimed at restoring Lake Groß-Glienicke (Berlin, Germany). In a novel approach, we firstly applied a heavy-liquid separation to the iron-rich surface sediments which allowed direct identification of vivianite by X-ray diffraction in the high-density (ρ 2.3 g cm-3) sediment fraction. Secondly, we assessed the contribution of vivianite to P retention, combining results from chemical digestion with magnetic susceptibility data derived from magnetic hysteresis measurements. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the dark blue spherical vivianite nodules were 40-180 μm in diameter, and formed of platy- and needle-shaped crystal aggregates. Although equilibrium calculations indicated supersaturation of vivianite throughout the upper 30 cm of the sediment, the vivianite deposits were homogeneously distributed within, and restricted to, the upper 23 cm only. Thus, supersaturated pore water alone cannot serve as a reliable predictor for the in situ formation of vivianite. In Lake Groß-Glienicke, vivianite formation continues to be triggered by the artificial iron amendment more than 20 yr ago, significantly contributing to P retention in surface sediments.},

This limitation of moisture present in sewage sludge can be obviated by using the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process.

The HTC process produces energy-rich hydrochar products and simultaneously enables phosphorus recovery.

The analysis includes various process temperatures (200 °C, 220 °C, and 240 °C) in the presence of deionized water, acids (0.1 M and 0.25 M; H2SO4, HCOOH, CH3COOH), and alkali (0.1 M and 0.25 M; NaOH) solutions as feed water. The results show that phosphorus leaching into the process-water, hydrochar yield, proximate analysis, and the heating value of produced hydrochar is pH- and temperature-dependent, and particularly significant in the presence of H2SO4. In contrast, utilization of H2SO4 and NaOH as an additive has a negative influence on the heating value of produced hydrochar.},

	abstract = {The treatment of wastewater not only helps to alleviate the scarcity of water and environmental challenges but also generates a by-product called Municipal Sewage Sludge (MSS). The MSS is a high moisture precipitant with plentiful organic and inorganic components. However, some pollutants in MSS components and its high-water content complicate its valorization, and thus, special attention is required for its valorization. Hydrothermal treatments (HTs) can be applied to feedstocks with high moisture content without pre-drying. These processes are gaining more attention to processing MSS into fuels and value-added materials. This work systematically reviews the findings recently emerged from HTs of MSS. The related chemical reactions and the effect of reaction parameters are highlighted based on most recent works. The problems addressed and those not yet addressed are also discussed. Some suggestions are made for the plausible applications of end products with the aim to optimize the whole process. Finally, insight is given into the future of MSS HTs and the concerns that might be the focus of substantial studies.},

	abstract = {Reusing waterworks aluminium (Al)- or iron (Fe)-sludge instead of chemical coagulants such as Al- or Fe-salts, is a credible solution for sulfide and phosphate control in sewer bulk phase for environmental and economic reasons. We comprehensively evaluated and compared the effects of direct dosing of waterworks Fe-/Al-sludge in pilot-scale sewer rising mains, particularly focusing on removal of sulfides and phosphate and underlying possible mechanisms. Changes in other sewage characteristics were also examined. Waterworks Fe-sludge dosing was effective for sulfide removal at a ratio of 0.29 ± 0.06 mg S/mg Fe, but exhibited limited effect on phosphate removal. Likewise, Al-sludge was effective for phosphate removal at ratio of 0.29 ± 0.01 mg P/mg Al, but with limited effect on sulfide removal. The mixing of the sludge stream with raw wastewater, i.e. dilution effect, was primarily responsible for observed reduction in soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) concentrations, under both Fe-/Al-sludge dosing. The Fe-/Al-sludge dosing did not cause any increment in dissolved methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) formation, nor release of other metals. Combined spectroscopic, spectrometric, and microscopic analyses suggest a precipitation reaction between sulfide and ferric ions in Fe-sludge, is likely to be the dominant mechanism for sulfide removal when dosing Fe-sludge. In terms of phosphate removal with Al-sludge dosing, ligand-exchange processes between surface hydroxyl (–OH) groups and PO43− ions, favouring the formation of both inner- and outer-sphere surface Al-phosphate complexes, appears to be the dominant mechanism. These findings showed the potential multiple benefits of dosing waterworks Fe-/Al-sludge in sewers. Further system-wide, long-term studies including a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis are warranted for optimisation.},

Effective and efficient management of alum sludge in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner remains a significant social and environmental concern with ever increasing demand for potable water as a result of rapidly escalating world population and urban expansion. Various intensive practices have been employed to reuse the alum sludge in an attempt to figure out how to fill the gap between successful drinking water treatment process and environmentally friendly alum sludge management for over the years. This paper primarily aimed at comprehensive review of the existing literature on alum sludge characteristics, its environmental concerns and their potential utilization, especially in agricultural and horticultural sectors leading to update our recent state of knowledge and formulate a compendium of present and past developments. Different types of alum sludge utilizations in various fields were recognized and examined. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and potential risks of alum sludge reuse options with particular reference to agriculture were highlighted and knowledge gaps were identified. Research priorities and future challenges that will support in the development of effective alum. sludge. management practices in agriculture with multi-prong strategies were discussed.},

This scheme, a modified version of the Williams protocol, was further tested in a second interlaboratory study. The so-called SMT extraction scheme seems promising and will provide, in the near future, a valuable tool for water managers in the field of lake restoration.

Yet, the product of sewage sludge pyrolysis (biochar) is currently not included on the list of eligible fertilizers in the new EU Fertilising Products Regulation. This was justified by insufficient evidence for organic contaminant removal through pyrolysis. Here I summarize the current evidence on this topic covering 20 studies and more than 100 different organic pollutants. The studies demonstrate that pyrolysis reduces the concentration of well-established contaminants, such as PAHs, PCBs, and dioxins, but also emerging ones, i.e., pharmaceuticals, hormones, antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, antimicrobials, microplastics, and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with very high efficacy ({\textgreater}95 to {\textgreater}99\% in most cases). After pyrolysis, the levels of organic contaminant in biochar were typically below the limit of detection. Furthermore, modern pyrolysis units prevent environmental release of contaminants that are only vaporized and not decomposed during pyrolysis by internal combustion of pyrolysis liquids and gases. The evidence for effective organic contaminant removal through pyrolysis is comprehensive, covering all relevant groups of compounds. This and its potential as negative emission technology makes pyrolysis of sewage sludge a great opportunity for sustainable and safe nutrient recycling.},

Chinensis var. utillis Tsen et Lee) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The SP has the highest P purity while the BP has the most complex P species. And the plant growth results showed that the RPFs greatly facilitated plant growth and demonstrated superior/comparable effects to those of MP/CoF. In general, choy sum fertilized with SP showed the best effect due to the Mg involved and the high P purity of SP, while ryegrass fertilized with BP performed the best among all of the groups because of the additional nutritional elements and the high P availability of BP. Additionally, the accumulation of heavy metals in the plants under all conditions did not exceed the limits stipulated in the regulations. These results indicate that recovering P from ISSA is an attractive technology to produce P fertilizers, which can alleviate both the scarcity of phosphate resources and the burden of ISSA management.},

In addition, the environmental risk potential of utilizing SSA in agriculture is still unclear, in particular potential toxic element (PTE) contamination. In this study, a mixture of SSA and rock phosphate was used at lab-scale superphosphate (SP) production. P availability of the final product and PTE contamination (Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni) in soil and crop was investigated through maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation. Results showed that the application of SP that was produced by 25\% SSA replacement did not affect the growth, P uptake, and PTE content in aboveground maize compared to the application of SP produced without SSA replacement. However, significant inputs of SP with SSA replacement may decrease the solid-soil solution partitioning of Cu, Ni and Pb in the long-term. Separation of municipal/industrial sludge and PTE removal technology are necessary to be implemented prior to the use of SSA as a secondary raw material in P-fertilizer production.},

The samples include crystalline hydroxyapatite, two type B carbonatoapatites containing 3.2 and 14.5\% C032', respectively, a hydroxyapatite in which approximately 12\% of the phosphate groups are present as HP042{\textasciitilde}, an amorphous calcium phosphate, monetite, (Calcium and inorganic orthophosphate form a variety of crystalline and noncrystalline solid phases that have been extensively used to help identify and characterize the solid inorganic mineral phases in bone and tooth. However, none of the synthetic calcium phosphate solid phases of known structure has the identical chemical, compositional, and structural characteristics of the mineral phase(s) found in bone and tooth. For example, the failure to uniquely identify the mineral phase(s) of bone by X-ray diffraction stems in part from the fact that the mineral crystallites are very small and the resulting X-ray diffraction patterns are too poorly defined to permit a unique solution to the structural analysis (Glimcher et al., 1981). In order to overcome this problem, we have examined the short-range atomic order around the phosphate groups of the solid mineral phases of biologically calcified tissues by 31P MASS1 NMR (Roufosse et al., 1984). However, in order to interpret the spectra obtained from bone and other calcified tissues, it is first necessary to examine and understand the 3IP MASS NMR spectra obtained from well-defined and characterized synthetic solid phases of CaP04. A number of the synthetic CaP04 solid phases studied have been postulated to be present in bone tissue. The synthetic solid phases of CaP04 studied in the experiments reported in this paper may be divided into three categories: (1) crystalline and poorly crystalline hydroxyapatites (HA and PCHA, respectively); (2) amorphous calcium phosphates (ACP); (3) crystalline compounds containing HP042{\textasciitilde} groups. The first category includes the crystalline compounds hydroxyapatite (HA), two type B carbonato-hydroxyapatites (CA) containing 3.2 and 14.5\% structurally substituted C032" ions, a type A carbonatohydroxyapatite (CA) in which all of the hydroxyl groups are replaced by C032-groups, a hydroxyapatite with approximately 12\% of its f From the brushite, and octacalcium phosphate. Spectra were observed by the standard Bloch decay and cross-polarization techniques, as well as by a dipolar suppression sequence, in order to distinguish between protonated and unprotonated phosphate moieties. The spectra of the synthetic calcium phosphates provide basic information that is essential for interpreting similar spectra obtained from bone and other calcified tissues. phosphate groups present as HP042", and a "poorly crystalline" hydroxyapatite (HA) obtained by the hydrolysis of ACP. The third group contains the well-defined mineral phases brushite (BRU), monetite (MON), and octacalcium phosphate (OCP). Standard Bloch decay and cross-polarization spectra were obtained on all samples, as were dipolar suppression traces to help distinguish resonances arising from protonated and un-protonated phosphate moieties. A computer study of the 31P MASS NMR spectra obtained from these well-defined synthetic CaP04 solid phases forms the basis for the interpretation of similar spectra observed from bone and other calcified tissues (Roufosse et al., 1984).

	abstract = {Solid state NMR EBPR Biological waste water treatment a b s t r a c t Polyphosphate (poly-P) is a major constituent in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants with enhanced biological phosphorus removal due to poly-P synthesis by poly-P accumulating organisms where it plays an important role for recovery of phosphorus from waste water. Our aim was to develop a reliable protocol for poly-P quantification by 31 P NMR spectroscopy. This has so far been complicated by the risks of inefficient extraction and poly-P hydrolysis in the extracts. A protocol for complete extraction, identification and quantification of poly-P in activated sludge from a waste water treatment plant was identified based on test and evaluation of existing extraction protocols in combination with poly-P determination and quantification by solution and solid state 31 P NMR spectroscopy. The total poly-P middle group content was quantified by solid state NMR for comparison with the poly-P middle groups quantified by solution NMR, which is novel. Three different extraction protocols previously used in literature were compared: 1) a single 0.25 M NaOH-0.05 M EDTA extraction, 2) a 0.05 M EDTA pre-extraction followed by a 0.25 M NaOH main extraction and 3) a 0.05 M EDTA pre-extraction followed by a 0.25 M NaOH-0.05 M EDTA main extraction. The results showed that the extraction protocol 2 was optimal for fresh activated sludge, extracting 10.8 ± 0.4 to 11.4 ± 1.2 mgP/gDW poly-P. Extraction protocols 1 and 3 extracted less than 9.4 ± 0.5 mgP/gDW poly-P. A comparison of the quantification of poly-P by 31 P solution NMR and by 31 P solid state NMR spectroscopy of lyophilised activated sludge showed 86 ± 9\% extraction efficiency of poly-P, which confirms that the extraction protocol recovered most of the poly-P from the samples without pronounced poly-P degradation.},

Considering a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with 65,000 t/a of mechanically dewatered digestate (29\% total solids), 550 t/a nitrogen and 500 t/a phosphorus were recovered from the 4900 t/a total nitrogen and 600 t/a total phosphorus that entered the WWTP. Overall, 3600 t/a (73\%) of total nitrogen was lost to the air (as N2) and clean water, while 90 t/a (15\%) of total phosphorus was lost to clean water released by the WWTP. Both in combustion and in pyrolysis, the nitrogen (3\%) released within thermal drying fumes was recovered through condensate stripping and subsequent gas scrubbing, and together with the recovery of nitrogen from WWTP reject water, a total of 3500 t/a of ammonium sulfate fertilizer can be produced. Furthermore, 120 GWh/a of district heat and 9700 t/a of ash with 500 t/a phosphorus were obtained in the combustion scenario and 12,000 t/a of biochar with 500 t/a phosphorus was obtained in the pyrolysis scenario. The addition of a stripper and a scrubber for nitrogen recovery increases the total electricity consumption in both scenarios. According to an approximate cost estimation, combustion and pyrolysis require annual investment costs of 2–4 M EUR/a and 2–3 M EUR/a, respectively, while 3–5 M EUR/a and 3–3.5 M EUR/a will be generated as revenues from the products.},

A central composite experimental design was used in the optimization of volatiles (bio-oil and syngas), biochar production, and the amount of carbon surface functional groups. Various types of oxygenated functional groups on the biochar were quantified by means of titrimetric techniques using a modified Boehm's method. The range of surface carbonyl groups amount was from 0.27 to 1.70 mmol/g carbon. The produced biochars were also characterized in terms of the elemental composition, BET surface area and chemical structure. The maximum surface area of the biochar was 45 m 2 /g. The result indicates that the surface functional groups of biochar were significantly influenced by the pyrolysis temperature and residence time. An adequate prediction model was developed to describe the development of carbon surface functional groups. Modification and characterization of biochar surface functional groups is a new way to improve or extend their catalytic application in biomass conversion and bio-oil upgrading.},

In this research, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (FTIR-DRIFT) technique was used, which relies on measuring the reflectance of the powdered substance's surface layer and capturing spectra in range of infrared wave. First, spectra correlation table of the substances mostly occurring in wastewater was developed to assess the main components of the tested samples of activated sludge. The simplest compounds containing functional groups characteristic for particular chemical classes were chosen: peptides (peptone and albumin), fats (glycerin and fatty acids), carbohydrates (glucose and sucrose), nitrogen compounds (NaNO 3 and NH 4 SO 4), sulfur compounds (Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 S 2 O 3), silicate, etc. The spectra of those substances were captured and characteristic absorption bands for respective bonds in the function groups were assigned. Second, samples of activated sludge from lab-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs), which purifies petroleum wastewater, were taken. Samples were properly prepared (lyophilization and homogenization) and their spectra were captured. During spectra analysis, previously developed correlation table was used. In obtained spectra of activated sludge, absorption bonds characteristic for amides, peptides, carbohydrates, fats, and aliphatic was identified. The spectra profile of the sludge sample from MBR feed with petroleum wastewater was slightly different from the control MBR sample's spectra. Intensity of bands in the area characteristic for aliphatic compounds and phenols was clearly higher. This study proves the usefulness of FT-IR technique to observe changes in the chemical composition of activated sludge.

A B S T R A C T With the quick increase in industrialization and urbanization, a mass of sludge has been produced on the account of increased wastewater treatment facilities. Sewage sludge (SS) management has become one of the most crucial environmental problems because of the existence of various pollutants. However, SS is a carbon-rich material, which has favored novel technologies for biochar production, which can be utilized for dissimilar applications. This review systematically analyzes and summarizes the pretreatment, modification, and especially application of sewage sludge-derived biochar (SSBC), based on published literature. The comparative assessment of pre-treatment technology such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, combustion, deashing, and co-feeding is presented to appraise their appropriateness for SS resource availability and the production of SSBC. In addition, the authors summarize and analyze the current modification methods and divide them into two categories: physical properties and surface chemical modifications. The applications of SSBC as absorbent, catalyst and catalyst support, electrode materials, gas storage, soil amendment, and sold biofuel are reviewed in detail. 2 Furthermore, the discussion about the existing problems and the direction of future efforts are presented at the end of each section to envisage SS as a promising opportunity for resources rather than a nuisance.},

Panethite, brianite, czochralskiite and new Na-Fe phosphate were described for the first time. The basic features of all studied phosphates include strong ν1 symmetric stretching mode of PO43− ions at 950–990 cm−1, antisymmetric ν3 vibrations in the 1000–1175 cm−1 region and weak bands in the 400–500 cm−1 region, which correspond to ν2 bending mode and in the 550–640 cm−1 region, related to ν4 bending mode. Weak bands at less than 300 cm−1 represent lattice modes. Most of the studied phosphates have three non-equivalent positions of phosphorus atoms in the crystal structures and can be derived from glaserite, K3Na(SO4)2, arrangement. Two or three of non-equivalent [PO4] tetrahedra typically correspond to two or three strong bands in the region of ν1 vibrations. High-pressure mineral tuite has similar composition and was formed after merrillite. P-O vibrations in equivalent [PO4] tetrahedra produce major Raman band of tuite at 972 cm−1. The Elga parent-body experienced a shock pressure of at least 12–15 GPa according to minimum pressures of tuite formation in the static high-pressure experiments. This is the first finding of tuite in iron meteorites and the only second finding of high-pressure mineral in them. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The influence of pH on Raman spectra of species was evaluated at various solution pH values, and the results showed accurate and selective analysis for phosphate and phosphite by using pH = 10.0 and bands located at 874 cm −1 and 2321 cm −1 , respectively. Linear working range in the 0.15\%-6.20\% (w/v) P concentration was consistently obtained with regression coefficients (r) of 0.9953 (PO 4) and 0.9945 (PO 3). The limits of detection were 0.10\% (w/v) P (PO 4) and 0.05\% (w/v) P (PO 3). Relative standard deviations were lower than 6\% for samples containing 10\% P 2 O 5 (PO 4) and 31\% P 2 O 5 (PO 3). Commercial fertilizers were analyzed by the proposed method using external calibration and found concentrations of P were in agreement with those obtained by the comparative spectrophotometric method at the 95\% confidence level (paired t-test).

In co-pyrolyzed biochars, the combined proportion of short-and medium-term P was {\textasciitilde}70 \%, with a short-to medium-term ratio of 1:3.4 4.3. The extrinsic P distributed in H 2 O-, NaOH-and HCl-P pools at proportions of {\textasciitilde}30 \%, {\textasciitilde}50 \% and {\textasciitilde}20 \%, respectively. The molar ratio of NaOH-P to Fe reached 1:1.7, suggesting a great potential of sludge Fe-oxides for P binding. The binding of extrinsic P was through the formation of iron hydroxyphosphate and adsorption mechanisms. By chemical extractions and instrumental analysis, this study illustrated an occluding effect for P extraction after pyrolysis, caused by the dehydration and crystallization of sludge Fe-oxides. The co-pyrolysis strategy effectively alleviated this effect due to the elimination of excessive Fe-oxides and improvement of P releasability. Consequently, it was superior in terms of the overall P availability. In addition, {\textasciitilde}80 \% of K was available within medium-term.

	abstract = {Vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2⋅8H2O) is a potential phosphorus (P) recovery product from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, routine methods for quantification of vivianite bound P (vivianite-P) are needed to establish the link between vivianite formation and operating conditions, as current approaches require specialized instrumentation (Mössbauer or synchrotron). This study modified a conventional sequential P extraction protocol by insertion of an extraction step (0.2\% 2,2′-bipyridine + 0.1 M KCl) targeting vivianite-P (Gu et al., Water Research, 2016, 103, 352–361). This protocol was tested on digested and dewatered sludge from two WWTPs, in which vivianite (molar Fe:P ratios of 1.0–1.6) was unambiguously identified by optical microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results showed that vivianite-P was separated from iron(III)-bound P (Fe(III)-P) in the sludge. Vivianite-P constituted about half of the total P (TP) in the sludge from a Fe dosing chemical P removal (CPR) WWTP, but only 16–26\% of TP in the sludge from a WWTP using a combination of Fe dosing CPR and enhanced biological P removal (EBPR). The modified protocol revealed that Fe-bound P (Fe-P, i.e., vivianite-P + Fe(III)-P) was the dominant P fraction, in agreement with quantitative 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Moreover, it was shown that the conventional P extraction protocol underestimated the Fe-P content by 6–35\%. The established protocol represents a reliable in-house analytical method that can distinguish and quantify vivianite-P and Fe(III)-P in sludge, i.e. facilitate optimized vivianite production at WWTPs.},

For the sludge mixture (a blend of primary and waste activated sludges), P speciation did not change significantly within 4.5 h at 125 °C HT, while soluble and labile P was converted into insoluble P over time at 175 and 225 °C HT. Strengite (FePO 4 ·2H 2 O) preferentially formed in the hydrochars with increasing treatment temperature and/or time, whereas 125 °C HT within 1.5 h favored the formation of vivianite (Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 ·8H 2 O). Organic P was completely decomposed into orthophosphate when the HT temperature reached up to 175 °C. Pyrrole-N was enriched in the hydrochars. Similar reaction pathways were observed during HT of anaerobically digested sludge, though some minor differences in Fe-associated P and organic P were observed. Meanwhile, HT of the two sludges released orthophosphate and ammonia into the process waters at 175 and 225 °C, which can be recovered by a sequential process involving struvite (MgNH 4 PO 4 ·6H 2 O) precipitation and air stripping. This study provides new insights into the transformation of P and N during HT of Fe-rich sludges as well as a modular design for maximum P and N recovery from the treatment products.},

	abstract = {Effective methods of biomass characterization are needed for energy production due to the increase in biomass to bioenergy conversion capacity and the availability of various biomass sources. The utilization of biomass has been enhanced through thermochemical conversion techniques such as torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification. The biomass analytical techniques have been developed to decrease the time and energy required for biomass conversion performance. Thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analytical techniques facing several limitations when applied individually. Thus, TG coupled with FTIR (TG-FTIR) was used to analyze the main parameters of biomass and improved the energy crop growing developments. In addition, TG-FTIR can determine the suitable ratio for two different biomass or coal blending during the co-pyrolysis and co-gasification to achieve the optimum synergetic interaction. In this review, thermo-chemical conversion processes such as torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification are presented. The analysis of the thermochemical conversion of biomass with the use of TG and FTIR individually are then discussed. Lastly, this review aims to discuss the applications of TG-FTIR techniques that have been applied to the analysis of evolved gas from the thermochemical processing of biomass to biofuels.},

All four categories of biochar alkalinity contributed to total biochar alkalinity and are therefore relevant to pH-sensitive soil processes. Total biochar alkalinity was strongly correlated with base cation concentration, but biochar alkalinity was not a simple function of elemental composition, soluble ash, fixed carbon, or volatile matter content. More research is needed to characterize soluble biochar alkalis other than carbonates and to establish predictive relationships among biochar production parameters and the composition of biochar alkalis.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a critical raw material and the EU largely depends on P-imports to cover its demand. This is increasing efforts to recover P from secondary P-sources such as municipal sewage sludge ashes (SSA) from mono-incineration. Usage of SSA for mineral fertilizer production requires compliance with certain quality standards regarding P-concentrations and trace element levels. This is particularly challenging in view of the variability in composition and amount of sewage sludge due to different technologies applied by the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and various catchment areas when sludge is jointly incinerated. By applying different sewage sludge treatment processes along the process chain, homogenization of the output quality of mono-incineration plants may be achieved. To investigate the effects of input variability and treatment processes on SSA composition a Monte-Carlo simulation approach was used. The simulations included probability distributions of sewage sludge composition data from 57 WWTP. Missing data were compensated by mean substitution to generate a complete set of input distributions. The resulting distributions of SSA nutrient and contaminant concentrations obtained by the simulation were compared.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus recovery from municipal sewage sludge is a promising way to alleviate the shortage ofphosphorus resources. However, the recovery efficiency and cost depend greatly on phosphorus species and fractions in dif- ferent sewage sludges, i.e., waste activated sludge and chemically enhanced primary sludge. In this review, the phosphorous (sub-)species and fractions in waste activated sludge and chemically enhanced primary sludge are systematically overviewed and compared. The factors affecting phosphorus fractions, including wastewater treatment process, as well as sludge treatment methods and conditions are summarized and discussed; it is found that phosphorus removal method and sludge treatment process are the dominant factors. The character- ization methods of phosphorus species and fractions in sewage sludge are reviewed; non-destructive extraction of poly-P and microscopic IP characterization need more attention. Anaerobic fermentation is the preferable so- lution to achieve advanced phosphorus release both from waste activated sludge and chemically enhanced pri- mary sludge, because it can make phosphorus species and fractions more suitable for recovery. A post low strength acid extraction after anaerobic fermentation is recommended to facilitate phosphorous release and im- prove the total recovery rate. ©2021ElsevierB.V.All},

	abstract = {Chemical phosphorus removal (CPR) is being increasingly adopted in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to enhance P elimination to comply with stringent discharge limits. However, strategies to recover P enriched in the produced waste activated sludge (WAS) are not well developed. In this study, we investigated the release of P in WAS from three WWTPs employing Al salt enhanced CPR by alkaline treatment. We also monitored P mobilization by tracking the dynamics of P fractions and species, the dissolution of major metals, and sludge cell integ-rities as pH was altered. The level of aqueous total phosphorus (TP aq) in the sludge increased significantly to N200 mg/L (from b11 mg/L in the raw sludge) as the pH was increased to 12, with the majority being PO 4-P aq especially at high pHs. The dominance of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) in the sludge-P, a good correlation observed between aqueous PO 4-P and aqueous Al, and the reversibility of P mobilization all suggest that the dissolution of Al-bound P was largely responsible for the sludge-P release. Sludge cell integrity, on the other hand, was not closely correlated with TP aq concentrations. Although the level of TP released in this study is among the highest, a more efficient strategy still needs to be developed to further enhance sludge-P release when TP content in the sludge mixture (TP mx) is considered (TP mx was N800 mg/L in this work).},

Endeavours to recycle phosphates from sewage sludge ash (SSA) have so far been limited by lacking understanding of material associations and the actual phosphate compounds in SSA. Owed to the high amorphous content of ashes, unlike X-ray diffractometry (XRD), automated mineralogy systems (MLA here) allow for a deeper study of phosphate-bearing phase associations in ashes. An intricate knowledge of target resource association is crucial for efficient recycling: this applies to all target products, elemental P, phosphoric acid or recycled fertiliser. Failing to understand these morphologies and target associations will inevitably lead to inefficient processes-perhaps even close off this resource completely. Thus, phase studies add to all P-recovery approaches from sewage sludge ashes. Sludge of three German cities has been incinerated under the same conditions and sampled, thus enabling an analysis of ash characteristics.},

Phosphorus from phosphate rock is widely employed in the food and feed, detergent, fertilizer, and other chemical industries. The elimination of phosphorus from the environment to aquatic ecosystems occurs by point and non-point sources. The loading of phosphate from sewage causes phosphate enrichment in the aquatic ecosystem leading to eutrophication. In the aquatic ecosystem, many directives and regulations have been put forth worldwide targeting phosphate removal from wastewater to reduce eutrophication. Phosphate removal could be achieved by physical, chemical, and biological methods. The physical and chemical methods require high energy and chemical inputs to produce a huge volume of sludge, making it difficult for disposal. Biological phosphate removal is advantageous over the other phosphate removal methods due to its simplicity and economic viability and therefore adopted widely in wastewater treatment plants. Enhanced biological phosphate removal treatment plants remove phosphate by enriching phosphate accumulating organisms that store phosphate intra-cellularly by alternating between aerobic and anaerobic cycles. Phosphate, being a non-renewable resource, the present scenario at Municipal Wastewater treatment plants involves phosphate removal targeting its recovery in a usable form for application in various sectors.},

To achieve these targets, a novel strategy including phosphorus capture by acid-resistant adsorbent from acid-extract of sewage sludge ash and repeated enrichment in eluent was first proposed in this study. Over 93\% of phosphorus was extracted by H 2 SO 4 acidification at pH of 2.0, and a tailored acid-resistant adsorbent recovered almost all the extracted phosphorus in acid-extract of sewage sludge ash. The fitting results of multiple models showed that the rate-limiting step for phosphorus recovery was chemical reaction, and the maximum recovery capacity of acid-resistant adsorbent was 41.7-44.0 mg/g. Characterization results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Zeta potential suggested that the recovery mechanism of acid-resistant adsorbent for phosphorus included ligand exchange, inner-sphere complexation and electrostatic attraction. After 8 cycles of recovery-repeated enrichment , the phosphorus in eluent was enriched about 6.7 times. Over 99\% of phosphorus in eluent was recovered as struvite by adding external magnesium and ammonium at pH of 8.5. The content of heavy metals in recovered struvite were far below the utilization standard of plant fertilizer, indicating that the phosphorus in sewage sludge ash could be recovered in the form of high-quality phosphorus fertilizer.},

In macro thermogravimetric analysis a sample size of approximately 1 g is used. All mass measurements are conducted by the system. In a typical analysis, the temperature is normally ramped from ambient to a specific temperature and held at that temperature for a prescribed length of time. The mass change is recorded repeatedly during the entire procedure. For the thermogravi- metric analysis of coal and coke samples the moisture and ash analyses are complete when the sample reaches a constant mass as defined in the instrumental operating parameters. Alternatively, the measurement of moisture and ash can be considered complete after heating the sample for a fixed period of time. In the volatile matter analysis, the samples are weighed after heating to 950°C and held at this temperature for 7 min.},

This review addresses several aspects of epidemiology, and pathogen-esis, environmental resource quality (air quality, hazardous waste management, and wastewater surveillance issues), and socioeconomic issues worldwide. The accelerated research activity in the development of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation, and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial socioeconomic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment) and further aggravated the countries' economic burden.},

The untreated, primary, secondary and tertiary treated wastewater samples were collected over a time frame ranging from under-lockdown to post-lockdown conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 out of 40 wastewater samples in Jaipur district, Rajasthan and in 5 out of 14 wastewater samples in the Haridwar District, Uttarakhand with the E gene predominantly observed as compared to the N and RdRp target genes in later time-points of sampling. The Ct values of genes present in wastewater samples were correlated with the incidence of patient and community cases of COVID-19. This study further indicates that the viral RNA could be detected after the primary treatment but was not present in secondary or tertiary treated samples. This study implies that aerobic biological wastewater treatment systems such as moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) are effective in virus removal from the wastewater. This work might present a new indication that there is little to no risk in relation to SARS-CoV-2 while reusing the treated wastewater for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater might present a potential route of viral transmission through WWTPs to sanitation workers and the public. However, there is a need to investigate the survival and infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.},

With nearly 250 scientific articles per year dealing with 27 Al NMR spectroscopy, this analytical tool has become popular because of the recent progress that has made the acquisition and interpretation of the NMR data much easier. The application of 27 Al NMR techniques to various classes of compounds, either in solution or solid-state, has been shown to be extremely informative concerning local structure and chemistry of aluminum in its various environments. The development of experimental methodologies combined with theoretical approaches and modeling has contributed to major advances in spectroscopic characterization especially in materials sciences where long-range peri-odicity and classical local NMR probes are lacking. In this review we will present an overview of results obtained by 27 Al NMR as well as the most relevant methodological developments over the last 25 years, concerning particularly on progress in the application of liquid-and solid-state 27 Al NMR to the study of aluminum-based materials such as aluminum polyoxoanions, zeolites, aluminophosphates, and metal-organic-frameworks.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus flue dust (PFD) is a solid waste product from phosphorus (P) production that contains P and is enriched with gallium (Ga). The recovery of these valuable components not only protects the environment, but also reduces resource waste. This study aimed to develop a green and efficient method to recover P and enriched Ga from PFD. The effects of different parameters on the P leaching rate and Ga loss rate during Na 2 CO 3 roasting and water leaching were investigated and optimized. The reaction mechanisms during the experiment were characterized, revealing that the P-containing compounds in PFD mainly transformed into water-soluble Na 3 PO 4. Furthermore, the leaching rate of P reached 85.38\%, while Ga was mainly concentrated in the residue and its loss rate was only about 1\%. Ga content in the residue reached about 0.1\%. An attempt was made to recover Na + and PO 4 3-from the aqueous solution by evaporative crystallization and XRD analysis showed that the main phase of the crystallization product was Na 2 HPO 4. The proposed process is technically simple, only Na 2 CO 3 is added and no hazardous substances are generated, and represents a new method for recovering P and enriching Ga from PFD.},

	abstract = {AIthough aluminum (AI) is abundant in soil environments, it is not an essential element and it is toxic to most organisms. Since the toxicity of AI depends on their chemical forms, the importance of AI speciation has been recognized worldwide. Difficulties in AI speciation are caused by the complex coordination chemistry of AI for the hydrolysis and formation of polynuclear species with a variable degree of solubility in aqueous solution. Nondestructive analyses, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, could supply primarily im-portant information on the chemical forms of AI and may enable to evaluate the results ob-tained by other methodologies. In the present report, NMR spectral characteristics of environmentally important AI-containing components, such as hydoxyaluminum ions, AI- inorganic complexes, AI-organic complexes, and primary and secondary minerals, are sum- marized for the nuclei of 27AI and 29Si determined by solution NMR and solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR. Applications of NMR techniques to soil science, including spe- ciation of phytotoxic AI in soil environments and whole soil NMR studies, are described.},

	abstract = {The field of wastewater management has seen a transition from "contaminant removal" in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to "nutrient recovery" in so-called water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) for years. For achieving a higher efficiency and economic benefits, the integration of multiple nutrient recovery technologies (NRTs) is of increased interest. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the integration of ammonia stripping, adsorption and struvite precipitation, three of the most dominant physicochemical NRTs. In their different combinations, a critical comparison of the available research is given from the perspective of process technical description, the current scale of application and potential challenges and perspectives ahead. The integration between ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation has been applied in either "one single integrated reactor" at lab scale or "multiple discrete reactors" at pilot/full scale. The collection of struvite should be further optimized, and "stripping → K-struvite precipitation" is expected to recover all of three macronutrients. In the technical integration between struvite precipitation and adsorption, small pristine adsorbents ({\textless}50 μm) have been used as the seeding material for struvite, while pristine and surface-modified adsorbents have been integrated with struvite precipitation as the sorbent material. Some magnesium-modified adsorbents achieved a higher removal efficiency and adsorption capacity than pristine adsorbent. The non-preferential adsorption is one of the main challenges limiting its upscaling. Lastly, stripping has been applied in the regeneration process of zeolite. Its economic benefits should be further analysed before its upscaling. This review proposed to apply adsorbents as the alternative of sulfuric acid in the acid scrubber following the stripping column. This new perspective may decrease the cost on ammonia stripping.},

	abstract = {Smouldering treatment of sewage sludge-and recapturing phosphorus-provides important steps towards a circular economy. This study reveals that bulking sludge with sand or another organic waste, e.g., woodchips, created a material that was readily converted to ash by self-sustained smouldering. Simultaneous phosphorus and regulated potentially toxic element releases from ash were evaluated using leaching methods from the USEPA Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF). Extraction potentials were also determined to evaluate direct recovery as an alternative to land application. Compared to the parent sludge, post-treatment ash from smouldering sludge with sand contained higher quantities of inorganic phosphorus in sorbed and mineral phases, which can provide beneficial slow phosphorus release to plants and avoid early phosphorus washout during land application. Ash also released lower initial and total quantities of potentially toxic elements than virgin sludge. As an alternative to land application, approximately 42\% of retained phosphorus can be recovered directly using acidic extraction, and an additional 30\% from emissions. In contrast, co-smouldering sludge with woodchips was more suited for direct recovery with 78\% of phosphorus potentially recoverable via emissions capture and yield increasing to 99\% with acidic extraction of resulting ash. Co-smouldering also produces a single post-treatment ash and can be readily operated continuously, which aligns with current incinerator configurations at wastewater treatment plants and makes adaptation highly feasible. With phosphorus reuse opportunities for land application and direct recovery, smouldering sewage sludge creates an important opportunity for a phosphorus circular economy as part of wastewater treatment sludge management.},

	abstract = {Background: Using secondary phosphorus (P) sources recovered from waste streams for base fertilization of soilless growing media may help conserve the global phosphate resources. However, little is known regarding the plant availability of P from secondary sources for soilless plant production. Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate the plant availability of P from sec-ondary sources using a peat-based growing medium and standard extraction methods. Methods: Seventeen secondary P sources differing in terms of feedstock and process-ing were tested, and their fertilization efficacy was compared with that of water-soluble monocalcium phosphate (MCP-P) in a pot experiment using marigolds. The correlation of plant P uptake with calcium chloride + diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (CAT) and/or calcium–acetate–lactate (CAL) extractable P amount in the growing medium (PCAT and PCAL, respectively) was examined. Results: Only three of the 17 tested secondary P sources (all struvite forms) exhibited comparable fertilization efficacy to MCP-P. The remaining sources showedP uptake vary-ing between 4\% and 91\% of MCP-P. For precipitates from liquid waste streams and untreated organic waste, except for sewage sludge and compost, the P uptake ranged from 71\% to 100\%. The highest variability (4\%–86\%) was observed for thermally and thermochemically treated secondary P sources. Plant P uptake was closely correlated withPCAT (R2 =0.76) andPCAL (R2 =0.78), and this correlation becameeven strongerwhen PCAT and PCAL were combined (R2 = 0.89). Conclusions: Most struvite forms meet the requirements of base P fertilization for soil-less plant production and can substitute water-soluble fertilizers obtained from primary P sources. The combination of PCAT and PCAL may be a promising approach to characterize the plant availability of P from secondary sources in soilless growing media and warrants further consideration.},

	abstract = {Land application of sewage sludge is increasingly used as an alternative to landfilling and incineration owing to a considerable content of carbon and essential plant nutrients in sewage sludge. However, the presence of chemical and biological contaminants in sewage sludge poses potential dangers; therefore, sewage sludge must be suitably treated before being applied to soils. The most common methods include anaerobic digestion, aerobic com-posting, lime stabilization, incineration, and pyrolysis. These methods aim at stabilizing sewage sludge, to eliminate its potential environmental pollution and restore its agronomic value. To achieve best results on land, a comprehensive understanding of the transformation of organic matter, nutrients, and contaminants during these sewage-sludge treatments is essential; however, this information is still lacking. This review aims to fill this knowledge gap by presenting various approaches to treat sewage sludge, transformation processes of some major nutrients and pollutants during treatment, and potential impacts on soils. Despite these treatments, overtime there are still some potential risks of land application of treated sewage sludge. Potentially toxic substances remain the main concern regarding the reuse of treated sewage sludge on land. Therefore, further treatment may be applied, and long-term field studies are warranted, to prevent possible adverse effects of treated sewage sludge on the ecosystem and human health and enable its land application.},

However modern agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock, which is a non-renewable resource and current global reserves may be depleted in 50-100 years. While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality of remaining phosphate rock is decreasing and production costs are increasing. Yet future access to phosphorus receives little or no international attention. This paper puts forward the case for including long-term phosphorus scarcity on the priority agenda for global food security. Opportunities for recovering phosphorus and reducing demand are also addressed together with institutional challenges. © 2009.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus is an element essential for life. Concerns regarding long-term security of supply and issues related to eutrophication of surface waters once released into the aquatic environment have led governments to consider and apply measures for reducing the use and discharge of phosphorus. Examples of source control include legislation to reduce phosphorus use in domestic detergents. This research shows that other domestic sources of phosphorus also contribute significantly to the domestic load to sewer and that overall, domestic sources dominate loads to sewage treatment works. Estimates provided here show that although the natural diet contributes 40\% of the domestic phosphorus load, other potentially preventable sources contribute significantly to the estimated 44,000 tonnes of phosphorus entering UK sewage treatment works each year. In the UK, food additives are estimated to contribute 29\% of the domestic load; automatic dishwashing detergents contribute 9\% and potentially increasing; domestic laundry 14\%, including contributions from phosphonates, but decreasing; phosphorus dosing to reduce lead levels in tap water 6\%; food waste disposed of down the drain 1\%; and personal care products 1\%. Although UK data is presented here, it is anticipated that similar impacts would be expected for other developed economies. Consideration of alternatives to all preventable sources of phosphorus from these sources would therefore offer potentially significant reductions in phosphorus loads to sewage treatment works and hence to the aquatic environment. Combining all source control measures and applying them to their maximum extent could potentially lead to the prevention of over 22,000 tonnes-P/year entering sewage treatment works.},

It involves the recovery of phosphorus and, normally, the separation of phosphates from harmful substances. Phosphorus can be recovered from wastewater, sewage sludge, as well as from the ash of incinerated sewage sludge, and can be combined with phosphorus removal in most cases. The phosphorus recovery rate from the liquid phase can reach 40 to 50\% at the most, while recovery rates from sewage sludge and sewage sludge ash can reach up to 90\%. There are various methods which can be applied for phosphorus recovery. Up to now, there is limited experience in industrial-scale implementation. The costs for recovered phosphate exceed the costs for phosphate from rock phosphate by several times. For German conditions, the specific additional costs of wastewater treatment by integrating phosphorus recovery can be estimated at €2–6 per capita and year.},

	abstract = {Development of methods to recover phosphorus will make handling of sewage sludge more sustainable. In earlier studies sludge incineration ash and SCWO-residues have been leached with acid and base. Acid leaching gives a high degree of recovery but releases besides phosphate also the main part of other metals (including heavy metals). This gives a large separation problem and gives a complicated process technology. Leaching with base (NaOH) gives a lower degree of recovery (up to about 50 \%) however with less dissolution of metals. When leaching with base, the calcium content in the sludge probably binds phosphorus as calcium phosphate. To improve leaching different possibilities can be studied such as use of a two-step leaching process. In a first step acid leaching dissolves calcium and magnesium. Treating the leachate with sulphuric acid, calcium sulphate (gypsum) is precipitated and phosphoric acid is obtained. Remaining ash or SCWO-residual product can afterwards be treated by alkaline leaching. Another alternative is to study leaching at anaerobic conditions. Since ferrous iron(II) phosphate is more soluble than ferric iron(III) phosphate the phosphate is more easily dissolved and the heavy metal contamination will be lower.},

The results indicate a high release of phosphorus at low pH-values with only use of acid, without heat or pressure. Digested sludge contains a lot of phosphorus, which is released with chemicals. Acid addition seems to be more useful for total phosphorus release in digested sludge than use of base. The introductory studies show that the amount of total phosphorus release is doubled for each unit drop in pH-value. There is a connection between the amount of chemicals needed to reach a wanted pH-value. The higher or lower pH-value, the more chemicals are needed.

Therefore, SS management is crucial for the economic and environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment plants. The recovery of nutrients from SS has been identified as a fundamental step to enable the transition from a linear to a circular economy, turning SS into an economic and sustainable source of materials. SS is often treated via anaerobic digestion, to pursue energy recovery via biogas generation. Anaerobically digested sewage sludge (ADS) is a valuable source of organic matter and nutrients, and significant advances have been made in recent years in methods and technologies for nutrient recovery from ADS. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview, describing the advantages and drawbacks of the available and emerging technologies for recovery of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) from ADS. This work critically reviews the established and novel technologies, which are classified by their ability to recover a specific nutrient (ammonia stripping) or to allow the simultaneous recovery of multiple elements (struvite precipitation, ion exchange, membrane technologies, and thermal treatments). This study compares the described technologies in terms of nutrient recovery efficiency, capital, and operational costs, as well as their feasibility for full-scale application, revealing the current state of the art and future perspectives on this topic.},

We examined P speciation and extractability in an acid sulfate paddy soil incorporated with oil palm ash (OPA) and biochar (OPB) during soil reduction and subsequent oxidation. Phosphorus K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the soil samples revealed that P in the soil mainly occurred as P adsorbed to ferrihydrite and P adsorbed to gibbsite. During soil reduction, gibbsite-bound P was transformed into variscite, which was back-transformed to gibbsite-bound P during soil reoxidation. Sequential extraction results confirmed the dominance of Fe/Al (hydr)oxides-bound P (average 72\%) in the soils. The OPA incorporation increased the exchangeable P pool concurring with the decrease in gibbsite-bound P. The OPB incorporation enhanced the dissolved P from the residual pool presumably due to electron shuttling of biochar with Fe(III) minerals during soil reduction. Our results highlight P dynamics in paddy soils, which are of immense importance for effective P-management strategies in rice cultivation.},

Extraction schemes using strong acids and alkaline solutions have been tested on different sediments and found not to extract well-defined fractions. In addition, several systematic errors in these schemes have been detected. Thus, these schemes have been modified and simplified accordingly. The Standards Measurements and Testing Program of the European Commission (SMT) method is a popular modification of these extraction schemes, as it is simple to handle, allows laboratories to achieve reproducible results and could provide a useful tool for routine use by water managers. The SEDEX (sequential extraction method) method, another popular modification, is widely applied in biogeochemical research as it can separate authigenic carbonate fluorapatite from fluorapatite. Other chemical extractions using chelating compounds have attempted to extract P bound with iron and calcium in sediments without disturbing clay-bound or organic P, the purpose being to determine the algal-available non-apatite, apatite and organic fractions of sediment P. All extraction procedures still yield operationally defined fractions and cannot be used for identification of discrete P compounds. Future modifications of the extraction scheme should aim to achieve better extraction efficiency and selectivity, simple handling techniques and methods that can prevent the extracted P from being re-adsorbed onto Fe(OOH) and CaCO3. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Limnology.},

	abstract = {The worldwide increase in amount of sewage sludge has recently attracted considerable interest in developing an efficient and economical sludge disposal method. A sewage sludge treatment process combining the hydrothermal treatment (HT) of sludge and the catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHTG) of its derived liquid (HT\&CHTG-Process) is proposed in this paper. Liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) value of 25–100 h−1 and liquid flow rate of 10–40 mL/min were employed with a self-designed CHTG experimental setup. During the first stage of the HT-Process, approximately 56\% of the carbon in the sludge was transferred into the derived liquid at 300 °C. During the second stage of the CHTG-Process, the derived liquid was gasified into CH4, H2, and CO2 using a Ni/carbon catalyst, and the carbon conversion reached 88\% at 350 °C and 20 MPa with a LHSV of 25 h−1. Using the integrated HT\&CHGT-Process, approximately 0.78 Nm3 of CH4, 0.62 Nm3 of H2 and 0.31 Nm3 of CO2 were generated from 1 kg of carbon in the sewage sludge. The combined process was expected to be an efficient method for sewage sludge treatment due to its mild conditions (≤350 °C and ≤20 MPa) and high yield of fuel gases.},

	abstract = {In this research work, raw poultry manure biochar (RPM-B) was post-modified by two metal salts and then evaluated for P recovery from aqueous solutions in batch mode. The modified biochar characterization showed that RPM-B impregnation with aluminum and manganese salts led to a significant improvement of their surface properties through the pH-zero charge reduction as well as the specific surface areas and the functional group contents increase. Phosphorus recovery tests indicated that the post-treated biochar with AlCl3 (RPM-B-Al) and with KMnO4 (RPM-B-Mn) exhibited relatively high recovery efficiencies with Langmuir’s adsorption capacities of 23.5 and 8.4 mg g−1, respectively. Kinetics and isothermal data modeling, as well as the in-depth analytical characterization of the post-modified biochars before and after adsorption, indicates that P recovery occurs homogeneously on monolayer surfaces through mainly anion exchange, precipitation, and electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, P desorption efficiency increases with the desorbing solution pH values. The best P desorption yields were observed for an initial pH of 9.0 to 78\% and 80\% for RPM-B-Al-P and RPM-B-Mn-P, respectively. All these results suggest that RPM-B-Al and RPM-B-Mn could be considered promising materials for phosphorus recovery from wastewaters with a possible reuse in agriculture as potential soil amendments.},

	abstract = {The impact of biochar on C storage and nutrient cycling when co-applied with other non-pyrolyzed organic amendments is still uncertain. Therefore, an incubation experiment for 120 days was conducted to attain an improved understanding of the capability of biochar for C accretions and nutrient release when co-applied with non-pyrolyzed organic materials like crop-residue (rice-residue) and manure (animal-manure). The results of the study showed that the individual application of biochar (RB), rice residue (RR), animal-manure (AM), or their co-application (RB+RR and RB+AM) enhanced C mineralization by 10\%, 85\%, 59\%, 63\%, and, 37\%, respectively than the unamended control. Even though the input of C in RB+RR and RB+AM was 82\% and 75\% more compared with the sole biochar amended soil, comparatively, percentage C loss per g of C added in RB+RR and RB+AM were only 12\% and 5\% greater than biochar amended soil. Therefore, the results of the study indicate stabilization of C released from labile sources (RR or AM) on the biochar surface that reiterates its greater C accretion potential. Furthermore, soil available nutrients showed no significant difference between the control and sole biochar amended soil, thus validating the limitations of applying biochar individually. On the other hand, a considerable correlation between microbial biomass with plant-available nutrients in the soil co-amended with biochar and non-pyrolyzed organic materials ensured greater availability of nutrients for crop uptake. Thus, co-application of biochar with non-pyrolyzed organic materials could be more beneficial for C accretion and release of nutrients compared with their individual application to soil.},

This pyrophosphate formation most likely resulted from the presence of acid phosphate groups in the precipitates. Under given conditions of ignition the amount of pyrophosphate was greater when the precipitate had a ratio of calcium to phosphate lower than that in hydroxyapatite. The slow rate of conversion suggested that diffusion might be the rate-controlling factor. Above 600° the pyrophosphate reacted with the hydroxyapatite to form (3-tricalcium phosphate, and this accounted for the decrease in pyrophosphate with increase in temperature. The evidence presented gives additional support to the current view that CaifPOOi-sHzO does not exist as a unique compound in precipitates from aqueous solutions.},

Struvite has a commercial value and the controlled formation and recovery of it would be beneficial.A mass balance was conducted at full scale across the whole sewage treatment plant in order to identify a stream to conduct bench-scale struvite crystallisation studies. The most suitable stream was identified as the centrifuge liquors. The average flow of the liquor stream was 393m3d-1 and the composition was as follows: 167mgL-1 phosphorus, 44mgL-1 magnesium, 615mgL-1 ammonium, 56mgL-1 calcium and 2580mgL-1 of alkalinity. The pH averaged at 7.6 and the stream had a predicted struvite precipitation potential of 140mgL-1.Struvite crystallisation occurred quickly during the trials, by raising the pH of the centrifuge liquors to 9.0 and dosing with magnesium. Up to 97\% phosphorus removal as struvite was achieved. Struvite formation occurred when the molar ratio of magnesium: phosphorus was at least 1.05:1. Below this ratio phosphorus removals of 72\% were observed, but not exclusively as struvite. Annual yields of struvite were calculated to be 42-100tonnes a year, depending on the dose regime. Revenue from the sale of produced struvite could be between £8400 and £20,000 a year. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

This lessening of the uncontrolled precipitation means a reduction of the operational problems and enhances the phosphorus availability for its later crystallization. High phosphorus precipitation and recovery efficiencies were achieved in both crystallization experiments. However, mixed thickening configuration showed a lower percentage of phosphorus precipitated as struvite due to the presence of high calcium concentrations. In spite of this low percentage, the global phosphorus mass balance showed that mixed thickening experiment produces a higher phosphorus recovery as struvite per kg of treated sludge (i.e., 3.6 gP/kg sludge vs. 2.5 gP/kg sludge in separate thickening). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Organic phosphorus is an important component of soil biogeochemical cycles, but must be extracted from soil prior to analysis. Here we critically review the extraction of soil organic phosphorus, including procedures for quantification, speciation, and assessment of biological availability. Quantitative extraction conventionally requires strong acids and bases, which inevitably alter chemical structure. However, a single-step procedure involving sodium hydroxide and EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate) is suitable for most soils and facilitates subsequent speciation by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Analysis of extracts by molybdate colorimetry is a potential source of error in all procedures, because organic phosphorus is overestimated in the presence of inorganic polyphosphates or complexes between inorganic phosphate and humic substances. Sequential extraction schemes fractionate organic phosphorus based on chemical solubility, but the link to potential bioavailability is misleading. Research should be directed urgently towards establishing extractable pools of soil organic phosphorus with ecological relevance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Amending poultry litter (PL) with aluminum sulfate (alum) has proven to be effective in reducing water-soluble phosphorus (P) in the litter and in runoff from fields that have received PL applications; it has therefore been suggested as a best management practice. Although its effectiveness has been demonstrated on a macroscopic scale in the field, little is known about P speciation in either alum-amended or unamended litter. This knowledge is important for the evaluation of the long-term stability and bioavailability of P, which is a necessary prerequisite for the assessment of the sustainability of intensive poultry operations. Both solid-state MAS and CP-MAS 31P NMR as well as 31P\{27Al\}-TRAPDOR were used to investigate P speciation in alum-amended and unamended PL. The results indicate the presence of a complex mixture of organic and inorganic orthophosphate phases. A calcium phosphate phase, probably a surface precipitate on calcium carbonate, could be identified in both unamended and alum-amended PL, as well as physically bound HPO42-. Phosphate associated with Al was found in the alum-amended PL, most probably a mixture of a poorly ordered wavellite and phosphate surface complexes on aluminum hydroxide that had been formed by the hydrolysis of alum. However, a complex mixture of organic and inorganic phosphate species could not be resolved. Phosphate associated with Al comprised on average 40 ± 14\% of the total P in alum-amended PL, whereas calcium phosphate phases comprised on average 7 ± 4\% in the alum-amended PL and 14 ± 5\% in the unamended PL.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P NMR) a b s t r a c t Phosphorus (P) recovery from sewage sludge is necessary for a sustainable development of the environment and thus the society due to gradual depletion of non-renewable P resources. Aerobic granular sludge is a promising biotechnology for wastewater treatment, which could achieve P-rich granules during simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes. This study aimed to disclose the changes in inorganic and organic P species and their correlation with P mobility and bio-availability in aerobic granules. Two identical square reactors were used to cultivate aerobic granules, which were operated for 120 days with influent ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 eN) of 100 mg/L before day 60 and then increased to 200 mg/L during the subsequent 60 days (chemical oxygen demand (COD) was kept constant at 600 mg/L). The aerobic granules exhibited excellent COD removal and nitrification efficiency. Results showed that inorganic P (IP) was about 61.4e67.7\% of total P (TP) and non-apatite inorganic P (NAIP) occupied 61.9e70.2\% of IP in the granules. The enrichment amount of NAIP and apatite P (AP) in the granules had strongly positive relationship with the contents of metal ions, i.e. Fe and Ca, respectively accumulated in the granules. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and solution index calculation demonstrated that hydroxyapatite (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 (OH)) and iron phosphate (Fe 7 (PO 4) 6) were the major P minerals in the granules. Organic P (OP) content maintained around 7.5 mg per gram of biomass in the aerobic granules during the 120 days' operation. Monoester phosphate (21.8\% of TP in extract), diester phosphate (1.8\%) and phosphonate (0.1\%) were identified as OP species by Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P NMR). The proportion of NAIP þ OP to TP was about 80\% in the granules, implying high potentially mobile and bio-available P was stored in the nitrifying aerobic granules. The present results provide a new insight into the characteristics of P species in aerobic granules, which could be helpful for developing P removal and recovery techniques through biological wastewater treatment.

	abstract = {This study investigates the potential of hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) for fractionating anaerobic digestate of sewage sludge into carbon-rich hydrochar and nutrient-rich aqueous phase (AP). AP is subsequently used to supplement cultures of the alkali halophilic microalgae D. tertiolecta (CCAP 19/30), to convert sodium bicar-bonate into sodium carbonate solution as part of an integrated biogas purification system. HTC at 200 • C gave the highest hydrochar yields (78\%) and solid carbon retentions (75\%), indicating high carbon capture potential. In contrast, the essential growth nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur were partially solubilised, resulting in HTC-AP concentrations between 11 times (S) and 50 times (P) higher than those in artificial growth medium. Trace nutrient concentrations in the AP were 10-80 times higher compared to the artificial medium, with minimal heavy metal solubilisation. Dunaliella tertiolecta grew successfully and without inhibition at HTC-AP concentrations up to 2\% (produced at 200 • C). AP-supplemented cultures achieved higher cell concentrations (up to 10.0 ×10 6 cells mL 1), biomass content (maximum of 1.14 ± 0.06 g L 1) and bicarbonate-to-carbonate conversion (83\% and 80\%, for 1\% and 2\% of HTC-AP) than the control cultures. Therefore, HTC-AP appears to be a suitable artificial growth medium substitute for cultivating alkali-halophilic microalgae to regenerate carbonate and produce algae biomass, providing an added-value product.},

We showed that being a composite material rich in carbon, CaO and MgO were produced in the biochar preparation when the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 700 °C. The phosphate adsorption of biochar has strengthened with the increase of pH. The phosphate adsorption of composite was fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, while the Langmuir adsorption iso-therm model yielded a maximum phosphate adsorption of 51.79 mg/g. The phosphate adsorption by sludge biochar was mainly affected by the deposition of phosphate crystals and electrostatic attraction. Overall, biochar prepared from dewatered dry sludge demonstrated acceptable phosphate removal performance and phosphate-loaded biochar had a slow release of phosphorus, therefore, can be used as a phosphate fertilizer to promote plant growth.},

A potential and practical concept of WWTPs and WAS treatments was proposed. a b s t r a c t The recovery of phosphorus from waste activated sludge (WAS) was usually at low levels due to low phosphorus release. This study presents a novel, cost-effective and eco-friendly pretreatment method, e.g., using free ammonia (FA) to pretreat WAS, to enhance the phosphorus release from WAS. Experimental results showed that the phosphorus release from WAS was significantly increased after FA pretreatment at up to 189.4 mg NH 3-N L À1 for 24 h, under which the released PO 3À 4 À P (i.e. 101.6 ± 6.7 mg L À1) was higher than that pH 9 (i.e. 62.6 ± 4.54 mg L À1) and control (without pH and FA pretreatment) (i.e. 15.1 ± 1.86 mg L À1). More analysis revealed that the FA induced improvement in phosphorus release could be attributed to the disintegration of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and cell envelope of sludge cells. Moreover, the released phosphorus recovered as magnesium ammo-nium phosphate (MAP) was confirmed. The findings reported may guide engineers to develop an economic and practical strategy to enhance resources and energy recovery from WAS.},

Considerable and rapid release of glycogen and protein was encountered after alkaline addition into the sludge. Only 45.0\% of sludge cells were destructed after 240 min treatment in R1 while the corresponding ratio was 96.1\% in R3 according to the release of DNA. Non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) in the alkaline treated sludge decreased due to the dissolution of Al(OH) 3 and AlPO 4 , which was the dominant reason for phosphorus release. Soluble orthophosphate (SOP) in the su-pernatant of alkaline treated sludge could be recovered quickly with the recovery efficiency of 84.6\% within 5 min and about 53-55\% of P participated in MAP reaction, producing large amounts of acicular crystals.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the feasibility of using alkaline fermentative short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as the carbon sources of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) microorganisms. First, the released phosphorus was recovered from the SCFA-containing alkaline fermentation liquid by the formation of struvite precipitation, and 92.8\% of the soluble ortho-phosphorus (SOP) could be recovered under conditions of Mg/P) 1.8 (mol/mol), pH 10.0, and a reaction time of 2 min. One reason for a Mg addition required in this study that was higher than the theoretical value was that the organic compounds consumed Mg. Then, two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated, respectively, with acetic acid and alkaline fermentative SCFAs as the carbon source of EBPR. The transformations of SOP, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and glycogen and the removal of phosphorus were compared between two SBRs. It was observed that the phosphorus removal efficiency was around 98\% with the fermentative SCFAs, and about 71\% with acetic acid, although the former showed much lower transformations of both PHAs and glycogen. The reasons that fermentative SCFAs caused much higher SOP removal than acetic acid were due to less PHAs used for glycogen synthesis and a higher PHA utilization efficiency for SOP uptake. Finally, the toxicity of fermentation liquid to EBPR microorganisms was examined, and no inhibitory effect was observed. It can be concluded from this study that the SCFAs from alkaline fermentation of waste activated sludge were a superior carbon source for EBPR microorganisms than pure acetic acid.},

The present study evaluated the feasibility of using bittern, a byproduct of salt manufacture, as a low-cost source of magnesium ions. High reaction rates were observed; the extent of nitrogen and phosphorus removals did not change beyond 10 min. Phosphorus removals from pure solutions with bittern added were equivalent to those obtained with MgCl 2 or seawater. Nitrogen removals with bittern were somewhat lower than with the alternate Mg 2þ sources, however. Application of bittern to biologically treated wastewater from a swine farm achieved high phosphate removal, but ammonia removals were limited by imbalance in the nitro-gen:phosphorus ratio.},

Results showed that NaOH was more suitable than Ca(OH)2 for sludge disintegration.

Low dose NaOH treatment ({\textless}0.2 mol/L) deteriorated sludge dewatering ability obviously, while the ability was recovered gradually with the increase of NaOH dose. For Ca(OH)2 treatment, the disintegrated floc fragments and soluble organic polymers can be re-flocculated with the help of calcium cations.

The actual concentrations of Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , K + , OP, NH 4 + , alkalinity and pH from a liquid swine manure system were used as inputs to the model. The model was modified to remove species with extremely low formation rates, because they would not significantly precipitate in the reaction occurring in a short retention-time process such as those envisioned for swine manure struvite-formation reactors. Using the model's output, a series of 19-L reactors were used to verify the results. Verification results demonstrated that Visual Minteq can be used to predetermine the concentration of amendments required to maximize struvite recovery.},

	abstract = {The releasing characteristics of phosphorus, nitrogen compounds, organics, and some metal cations during thermal treatment of excess sludge were investigated. It was found that during heating not only phosphorus, but also nitrogen compounds, organics, and some metal cations could be released in abundance. The maximum orthophosphate (ortho-P) release of about 90 mg/L in concentration was observed at 50°C in 1 h. Except for volatile fatty acids (VFAs), comparatively little total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), and metal cations were released at the same time. Such results might favor further process of phosphorus recovery. VFAs were considerably released only at 50°C. Acetic, butyric, and propionic acid were the most abundant components in turn and their releasing profiles exhibited good linear relationship with time (R 2 = 0.9977, 0.9624, and 0.8908, respectively). The concentrations of Mg 2+ and K + increased with time and temperature during thermal treatment, but Ca 2+ decreased. The release of Mg 2+ and K + agreed well with TP release (R 2 = 0.9892 and 0.9476, respectively). Temperature in the experimental range had very little impact on the linear relationships, especially of Mg 2+. Moreover, the parameter of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) was found to be an important factor for thermal sludge treatment as the released ortho-P and total phosphorus (TP) at 50°C increased more than one-fold when MLSS was increased from 4000 to 8000 mg/L.},

The additions of a strong base (NaOH), strong acid (HCl), organic acid (citric acid), and sodium acetate to waste sludge all facilitated the release of phosphate into solution. The maximum phosphate release was obtained by adding 4.9 mmole/L ({\textasciitilde}400 mg/L) of acetate to an intermittently mixed digester. Excess amounts of acetate did not further increase the phosphate concentrations. Acetate addition, which triggers carbon storage, a unique characteristic of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) processes, releases internally stored phosphate compounds and is recommended as a method for releasing phosphates from EBPR sludges.

Results show that the inorganic P (IP) content increased as the organic P content decreased, and the bio-availability of P increased because IP is a form of phosphorous that can be directly absorbed by plants. 31 P NMR analysis results indicate the change in P fractions at different temperatures. Non-apatite P was the dominant form of P under low-temperature drying and roasting, whereas apatite P was the major one under high-temperature drying and roasting. Results indicate that temperature affects the transformation of P.},

A B S T R A C T Aluminum-based chemically enhanced primary sedimentation has seen increasing use in wastewater treatment plants. However, the derived sludge (Al-sludge) has low biodegradability due to the inhibition of Al-coagulants on organic hydrolysis, which increases the difficulty of sludge treatment and limits the potential for resource recovery. In this study, the effects of pH adjustment on the pretreatment and fermentation of Al-sludge was investigated, with a focus on sludge hydrolysis and production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The effects of abiotic and biotic hydrolysis on sludge disintegration, organics solubilization, and hydrolytic enzyme activity were also evaluated. The results show that adjustment of the pH to between 8.0 and 10.0 was more effective than adjustment to between 2.0 and 6.0 for sludge hydrolysis and subsequent VFA production. The enzymatic activities of protease and α-glucosidase showed a positive correlation with the pH values, leading to the highest VFA yield (275 mg-COD/g-VS) for the initial pH 10.0 condition, with 46\% improvement over the control reactor (without pH adjustment). Semi-continuous fermentation was found to be more effective than batch fermentation for the biotic hydrolysis rate, k H. Little phosphorus ({\textless} 0.1 mg/L) was released from the Al-sludge into the fermented sludge liquor, so P removal was not necessary before the VFAs were used. The wastewater treatment process with Al-based chemically enhanced primary sedimentation and pH adjustment for enhanced sludge fermentation can recover 24\% of organic carbon from domestic wastewater.},

	abstract = {• Pretreatment methods compared using same activated sludge for P release. • Release of P was not well correlated with those of COD or N. • Efficient P release by pH adjustment was due to orthophosphate dissolution. • Anaerobic digestion was ineffective for P release regardless of sludge pretreatment. A B S T R A C T Phosphorus-rich waste activate sludge (WAS) has attracted considerable attention as an excellent material for P recovery from sewage. For a satisfactory recovery rate, an efficient release of P from WAS is critical. This paper investigated the effectiveness of four classes of sludge pretreatments, i.e., thermal hydrolysis, sonication, pH adjustment and ozonation, on P release from thickened WAS of an A 2 O wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Standards, Measurements and Testing protocol (SMT, by European commission), 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to elucidate the evolution of P fractions and their distribution during the pretreatments and the followed anaerobic sludge digestion (only sonicated and thermal hydrolyzed sludge). For the studied WAS (inorganic P content: 74\%), the results show that pH adjustment, among the sludge pretreatment methods, was the most effective to release P with the resulting aqueous total P (TP aq) amounting to 30\% and 34\% of the sludge total P (TP mx) at pH2 and pH12, respectively. The releases of P were not noticeably correlated with those of COD or N, suggesting different sources and mechanisms. The pH adjustment-induced P releases were mostly due to the dissolution of orthophosphate. Anaerobic digestion (AD) was not an effective way to release P from WAS regardless of sludge pretreatments, while pretreatments resulting sludge disintegration significantly improved P mineralization during AD. Because of the difficulty in separating those fine phosphate particles (often observed in WWTP sludge) for recovery, we suggest induction of in situ crystallization of phosphate during AD to be more researched in addition to the conventional re-dissolution-crystallization route.},

	abstract = {Scientific Reports {\textbar} (2022) 12:617 {\textbar} https://doi. Excessive discharge of phosphorus into the water bodies is the key factor to cause eutrophication. The fruit and vegetable wastewater contains large amounts of phosphorus, and it may be directly discharged into water bodies, which has a great burden on the municipal sewage pipe network. Therefore, coagulation was used to remove phosphorus, recovered the phosphorus from the wastewater into the precipitate, and then the precipitate was pyrolyzed as an efficient adsorbent for phosphate removal. By comparing the adsorption effects of adsorbents (XT-300, XT-400, and XT-500) with pyrolysis temperatures of 300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C on phosphate in actual phosphorus-containing wastewater and simulated phosphorus-containing wastewater at different adsorbent dosage (4 g/L, 7 g/L, and 10 g/L), it was found that XT-300 had the best performance of adsorption, and the adsorption of phosphate was endothermic and obeyed the Langmuir isotherms and Elovich kinetics. The influence of pH, coexisting anions, and the structure of XT-300 revealed that the removal of phosphate was associated with electrostatic attraction, pore filling, but could not be determined whether it was related to surface precipitation. This study provides a way and method for the recovery and utilization of phosphorus in fruit and vegetable wastewater and proves that the synthetic adsorbent was an efficient phosphorus adsorbent. In the long term, we can try to use the adsorbent after phosphorus adsorption to promote plant growth in agricultural systems. A high concentration of phosphorus in water bodies can pose a serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem and environmental quality. The high concentration of phosphorus-containing wastewater may be discharged into the natural environment, it's still a tough environmental problem around the world. High concentrations of phosphate can worsen the quality of aquatic ecosystems by stimulating the growth of organisms, especially algae, in the water bodies 1-3. It also harms aquatic flora and fauna, and human well-being 4-6. The natural recovery efficiency of phosphate is very low because phosphate is temporarily converted into precipitation and then released into water again 7. Therefore, it is imperative to explore an efficient technology for phosphorus removal and recovery. There are many technologies had been used to reclaim phosphorus from wastewater, such as struvite crystallization 8 , membrane hybrid system 9 , algal-based biosorption 10 , calcium precipitates 11 etc. Among them, chemical phosphorus removal would produce a large amount of sludge due to phosphorus precipitation which might lead to new pollution 12. The biological method for phosphorus removal is sensitive to operation parameters and the efficiency is unstable 13,14. In addition, biological treatment involves waste-activated sludge treatment or other pretreatment units, which would increase the cost of wastewater treatment. The adsorption method has low-cost and high efficiency. Therefore, it has been widely used to remove phosphate from water 15. Bioretention system is a widely used adsorption phosphorus removal system. Its phosphorus removal efficiency is highly variable and unstable. This is mainly due to the small capacity and poor stability of phosphorus adsorbed on the filter media of the biological retention system, resulting in a high phosphorus leaching effect. Therefore, phosphorus removal can be enhanced by new filter media in the biological retention system, and the application of high-efficiency and low-cost phosphorus removal materials has also received extensive attention.},

This study investigates the influence of persulfate on the transformation of phosphorus (P) and heavy metals (HMs) during the hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge. The hydrothermal temperature, time, and persulfate concentration are optimized by a Box-Behnken design to obtain the best sludge dewaterability, which is expressed by capillary suction time (CST). The highest CST reduction efficiency is 90.5\% at the optimal hydrothermal temperature, time, and concentration of persulfate, which are 145 °C, 2 h, and 150 mg/g dry sludge (DS), respectively. The distribution and transformation of P and HMs with different persulfate concentrations (100–200 mg/g DS) during the hydrothermal process are investigated. Results show that more than 90\% of the P and HMs in the sludge are retained in sludge cakes after the hydrothermal treatment. The addition of SPS can make the P in the sludge cakes transform into more stable P species according to the extraction capacity of sequential extracts. It can be found from the ecological risk indexes of the HMs that the addition of SPS during the hydrothermal treatment of sludge can reduce the environmental risk of HMs. This study provides insights into the P and HM distribution and transformation during hydrothermal treatment with persulfate, providing a reference for sludge recovery strategies.},

	abstract = {Aluminium ions in solution show a marked tendency to hydrolyse with the formation of soluble polynuclear hydroxo complexes and precipitates of the trihydroxide, both of which are substantially unreactive. As the stability constant of the aluminium-EDTA complex is rather low, relatively high p H values are necessary to ensure complete formation of the complex; these pH values approach the critical range for hydroxide precipitation. Under these circumstances direct macro-scale titrations are of uncertain accuracy and direct micro-scale titrations become practically impossible to carry out. These problems can be overcome by the use of back-titration procedures coupled with carefully controlled p H adjustment in order to avoid locally exceeding the critical value for hydroxide precipitation. With macro-scale titrations the p H can be adjusted satisfactorily in a stepwise manner, but for micro-scale titrations the p H must be increased homogeneously. This type of increase can be achieved by using hexamine, which slowly releases ammonia in boiling aqueous solutions. Based on these observations, a procedure is presented that provides for the complexometric determination of aluminium at concentrations down to 0.5 p.p.m., with an accuracy of 1 per cent. or better. THE behaviour of aluminium ions in solution renders special precautions necessary in the complexometric determination of this element. The more important factors to be taken into account are : firstly, that aluminium(II1) solutions show a marked tendency to hydrolyse; secondly, that the solubility of aluminium trihydroxide is very low; thirdly, that the precipitated aluminium trihydroxide and also the soluble polynuclear hydroxo complexes are rather unreactive; fourthly, that aluminium ions react relatively slowly with EDTA; and finally, that the stability constant of the aluminium-EDTA complex is rather low for a tervalent element. Many inve{\textasciitilde}tigatorsl-{\textasciitilde} have described procedures for the titration of milligram amounts of aluminium in concentrations of about M. In most papers it is concluded that indirect titrations are superior to direct titrations; an accuracy of 1 per cent. can be attained when EDTA is added in excess at pH 3-0, the solution is boiled for several minutes, and finally the back-titration is carried out at pH 5 to 6. However, this procedure involving a stepwise change in pH is not suitable for the determination of aluminium(II1) at lower concentrations (lo-* M). Flaschka, ter Haar and Bazen7 were the only authors to report a micro-scale titration of aluminium; errors of about 10 pg in 100 to 900 pg were found. Much better results, however, can be obtained. In this paper it will be shown that even micromolar amounts of aluminium can be titrated in the p.p.m. range with a precision of 1 per cent., provided that a special neutralisation procedure is followed. THE FORMATION OF HYDROXIDES-The formation of soluble polynuclear hydroxo complexes and the formation of a precipitate both depend on the pH as well as on the concentration of aluminium. At low concentrations only mononuclear complexes will be formed. Maximum concentrations exist at which polycomplexation and precipitation commences ; such a maximum concentration is a function of the pH. The equations for these maximum concentrations are derivedbelow. The values found in the literat{\textasciitilde}re83{\textasciitilde} for the stability constants (*/I) of A1(OH)i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are log *PI =-4.3, log *pz =-9.3, log *ps =-15 and log */I4 =-22.0 (*pi = 'M(OH)il x [HIi). In the absence of polycomplexes and a precipitate, the distribution of the various mononuclear complexes calculated with these values is as represented [MI @ SAC and the author.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus recovery from industrialized poultry operations is necessary to ensure sustainable waste management and resource consumption. To realize these goals, an innovative, two-stage process chemistry has been developed to extract nutrients from poultry litter and recover value-added products. Over 75\% phosphorus extraction was achieved by bubbling carbon dioxide into poultry litter slurries and adding strong acid to reach pH 4.5e5.5. After separating the nutrient-deficient poultry litter solids and the nutrient-rich liquid, the extract pH was increased through aeration and strong base addition. Over 95\% of the extracted phosphorus was recovered as solid precipitate at pH 8.5e9.0. High-purity struvite and potassium struvite products were selectively recovered through pH control, introduction of a calcium-complexing agent, and addition of magnesium chloride. The nitrogen-to-phosphorus-to-potassium (NPK) ratio of the recovered solids was controlled through aeration and pH adjustment. Precipitation at pH 8.5e9.0 and 10.5e11.0 resulted in NPK ratios of 2.0:1.0:0.1 and 0.9:1.0:0.2, respectively. The process effluent was effectively recycled as makeup water for the subsequent batch of poultry litter, thereby decreasing water consumption and increasing overall nutrient recovery. Sequencing batch operation yielded greater than 70\% phosphorus recovery within a 45-min process, demonstrating the potential for this technology to alleviate nutrient pollution in agricultural settings and generate an alternative supply of phosphorus fertilizers.},

	abstract = {• Extraction conditions of two-step extraction method were optimized. • P-precipitates were obtained by adding Ca(OH) 2 and NaOH to P-extracts. • Two-step extraction method can produce high purity of P leachate. • Adding Ca(OH) 2 for pH adjustment can induce more CaP formation. • Two-step P-precipitate by adding Ca (OH) 2 showed highest purity and contained effective soil restorer. A B S T R A C T The recovery of phosphorus (P) from acid extracts of incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) is invariably complicated by the co-dissolution of metal(loid)s. An extra purification treatment step is thus needed, which reduces the efficiency of P recovery. This study developed a two-step extraction method which can produce highly purified P-extract where ISSA is treated first with ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid (EDTA) and then with sulphuric acid. The recovery conditions of this two-step extraction method were optimized (pre-extraction by 0.02 mol/L of EDTA at a liquid to solid ratio (L/kg) of 20:1 during 120 min, then extraction by 0.2 mol/L sulphuric and at a liquid to solid ratio of 20:1 during 120 min). Compared with direct extraction by sulphuric acid (namely, single-step leaching), the two-step extraction method dissolved 2.34 mmol/kg ISSA less of P, but with 5.16 mmol/kg ISSA less of metal(loid) contamination. Furthermore, the potential for co-precipitation of P and the metal(loid) contaminates in the extracts (both single-step extraction and the two-step extraction methods) was examined from pH 2 to 12 (adjusted by addition of NaOH and Ca(OH) 2). By applying Ca(OH) 2 and at the optimal pH of 4, the two-step extraction method could significantly increase CaP in the precipitate and notably decreased the metal(loid) contaminants by 50\% compared to the single-step method.},

Phosphorus is essential for food production and modern agriculture currently sources phosphorus fertilizers from finite phosphate rock. The 2008 food and phosphate fertilizer price spikes triggered increased concerns regarding the depletion timeline of phosphate rock reserves. While estimates range from 30 to 300 years and are shrouded by lack of publicly available data and substantial uncertainty, there is a general consensus that the quality and accessibility of remaining reserves are decreasing and costs will increase. This paper clarifies common sources of misunderstandings about phosphorus scarcity and identifies areas of consensus. It then asks, despite some persistent uncertainty, what would it take to achieve global phosphorus security? What would a ‘hard-landing’ response look like and how could preferred ‘soft-landing’ responses be achieved?},

	abstract = {Phosphorus, a limiting element, is essential for living organisms, but the total amount available is decreasing with its increasing use. This problem can be solved by studying the methods of phosphorus recovery from waste. Phosphorus (P2O5, 13.75\%) is abundantly present in cattle manure bottom ash (CMBA), indicating its potential as a source for phosphorus recovery. Herein, phosphorus recovery from CMBA was investigated by acid extraction and precipitation methods. The optimum concentration of sulfuric acid for extraction was 1.4\&nbsp;M, which eluted approximately 90\% of the phosphorus contained in CMBA. In the precipitation method, sodium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate (CSH, CaSiO3∙nH2O) were used to adjust the solution pH to 4 and 8, where more than 99\% of the eluted phosphorus was recovered when the pH was adjusted to 8 using CSH alone. The chemical composition and crystal forms of the recovered precipitates were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence and an X-ray powder diffractometer. The results indicated monetite and brushite were the main crystal forms of precipitates at pH 4, and struvite, hydroxyapatite, and tricalcium phosphate were the main crystal forms at pH 8. The availability of phosphorus in the precipitates was also evaluated by quinoline gravimetric analysis using water and 2\% citric acid, and the water-soluble precipitate was less than 35\%, whereas it ranged from 65 to 97\% in 2\% citric acid. This study suggests that CMBA can be used as a promising source to recover phosphorus via acid extraction and precipitation processes.},

Lower L/S ratio put forward the dried sludge as a more advantageous resource for phosphorus extraction. Besides, by alkaline leaching of sludge ash and dried sludge, 60.3 and 70.3\% phosphorus dissolutions were achieved with 75 ml/g and 1N NaOH; and the leachate was a suitable product for phosphorus precipitation due to its high pH.},

	abstract = {The sewage sludge generated by the wastewater treatment plants is quite a hazardous waste. It may contain heavy metals, pathogenic bacteria (including those resistant to antibiotics due to their interaction with them) and viruses, helminths, acrylamide and drugs, including antibiotics. The selective elimination of certain risks does not make the sewage sludge safe for the environment. The purpose of this article is to implement a common sludge processing methodology with the elimination of biological risks, antibiotics and heavy metals. Incineration can eliminate most of the risks associated with sludge, leaving only heavy metals. Although the content of heavy metals in the ash increases (due to the destruction of organic matter and water vaporization), at the same time it is a prospective source of phosphorus (20.59 ± 0,00 \% P2O5). The extraction of phosphorus from the ash sludge has a very good yield in the extremely acidic environment of 83.57\%, using nitric acid. Extraction yield for most heavy metals investigated has a yield of over 50\% (Cu – 66.54 \%, Mn – 66.28 \%, Zr – 61.33 \%, Zn – 60.59 \%, Cr – 57.47 \%), less Ni with 29.94 \%. Si and Ti migrate very slightly (0 \% and 0,48 \%, respectively). By treating the extract solution with a basic agent (eg KOH), most of the components studied (Al, Ni, P, Cu, Cl, Cd, Co, Zn, Fe, Pb and S in form of SO42-) decant with a yield {\textgreater} 90\%, only Cr has a precipitation yield {\textless} 80\%. As the pH increases, P, Cl, Fe, SO42- decant similarly to Al in the solution. Heavy metals Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni tend to settle at a higher pH than P, while Pb and Cr under the same conditions as P.},

	abstract = {Phosphate rocks are an irreplaceable resource to produce fertilizers, but their availability will not be enough to meet the increasing demands of agriculture for food production. At the same time, the accumulation of phosphorous discharged by municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is one of the main causes of eutrophication. In a perspective of circular economy, WWTPs play a key role in phosphorous management. Indeed, phosphorus removal and recovery from WWTPs can both reduce the occurrence of eutrophication and contribute to meeting the demand for phosphorus-based fertilizers. Phosphorous removal and recovery are interconnected phases in WWTP with the former generally involved in the mainstream treatment, while the latter on the side streams. Indeed, by reducing phosphorus concentration in the WWTP side streams, a further improvement of the overall phosphorus removal from the WWTP influent can be obtained. Many studies and patents have been recently focused on treatments and processes aimed at the removal and recovery of phosphorous from wastewater and sewage sludge. Notably, new advances on biological and material sciences are constantly put at the service of conventional or unconventional wastewater treatments to increase the phosphorous removal efficiency and/or reduce the treatment costs. Similarly, many studies have been devoted to the development of processes aimed at the recovery of phosphorus from wastewaters and sludge to produce fertilizers, and a wide range of recovery percentages is reported as a function of the different technologies applied (from 10–25\% up to 70–90\% of the phosphorous in the WWTP influent). In view of forthcoming and inevitable regulations on phosphorous removal and recovery from WWTP streams, this review summarizes the main recent advances in this field to provide the scientific and technical community with an updated and useful tool for choosing the best strategy to adopt during the design or upgrading of WWTPs.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge is here studied as a valuable source for processing or energy conversation thanks to its high nutrition and energy content. However, various origins of the wastewater, different water cleaning technologies, and seasonal and regional dependencies lead to the high variability of the sewage sludge properties. In thermal treatment units, that is, incineration, gasification and pyrolysis, sewage sludge serves as feedstock or fuel, hence a proper characterization and a mathematical description of the sewage sludge are required to estimate product streams and to formulate numerical simulations and optimization methods. The presented work introduces a surrogate concept that allows replication of sewage sludge\&rsquo;s ultimate composition, moisture, and ash content. The surrogate approach aims to model the decomposition of any sewage sludge sample, opposite to the established determination of kinetic rates for individual samples. Based on chemical solid surrogate species and corresponding reaction mechanisms, the thermal decomposition path is described. Sewage sludge is represented by a combination of lignocellulosic species, proteins, sugars, lipids, and representative inorganic species. The devolatilization and heterogeneous reactions are formulated such that they can be used together with a detailed gas-phase model, including tar oxidation and emission models for nitrogen and sulfur oxides, recently proposed by the authors. The developed chemical model is applied using a zero-dimensional gasification reactor in order to model weight loss within the thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis, gasification and combustion conditions. Weight loss, the composition of product gases, and emission release (nitrogen and sulfur oxides) are captured well by the model. The flexible surrogate approach allows us to represent various sewage sludge samples.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of energy and phosphorus (P) fertilizer (PF) recovery from municipal sewage sludge (MSS) through incineration in new combustion plants. We evaluated the economic impact of five critical process design choices: (1) boiler type, (2) fuel (MSS mono-combustion/co-combustion with wheat straw), (3) production scale (10/100 MW), (4) products (heat, electricity, PF), and (5) ash destination. Aspen Plus modeling provided mass and energy balances of each technology scenario. The economic feasibility was evaluated by calculating the minimum selling price of the products, as well as the MSS gate fees required to reach profitability. The dependency on key boundary conditions (operating time, market prices, policy support) was also evaluated. The results showed a significant dependency on both energy and fertilizer market prices and on financial support in the form of an MSS gate fee. Heat was preferred over combined heat and power (CHP), which was feasible only on the largest scale (100 MW) at maximum annual operating time (8000 h/y). Co-combustion showed lower heat recovery cost (19\&ndash;30 \&euro;/MWh) than mono-combustion (29\&ndash;66 \&euro;/MWh) due to 25\&ndash;35\% lower energy demand and 17\&ndash;25\% higher fuel heating value. Co-combustion also showed promising performance for P recovery, as PF could be recovered without ash post-treatment and sold at a competitive price, and co-combustion could be applicable also in smaller cities. When implementing ash post-treatment, the final cost of ash-based PF was more than four times the price of commercial PF. In conclusion, investment in a new combustion plant for MSS treatment appears conditional to gate fees unless the boundary conditions would change significantly.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential resource for food production and chemical industry. Phosphorus use has to become more sustainable and should include phosphorus recycling from secondary sources. About 20\% of P ends up in sewage sludge, making this a substantial secondary P source. There is currently a technological gap to recover P from sludge locally at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that remove P by dosing iron. Vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2•8(H2O)) is the main iron phosphate mineral that forms during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, provided that enough iron is present. Vivianite is paramagnetic and can be recovered using a magnetic separator. In this study, we have scaled up vivianite separation from lab-scale to bench- and pilot-scale. Bench-scale tests showed good separation of vivianite from digested sewage sludge and that a pulsation force is crucial for obtaining a concentrate with a high P grade. A pilot-scale magnetic separator (capacity 1.0 m3/h) was used to recover vivianite from digested sewage sludge at a WWTP. Recirculating and reprocessing sludge allows over 80\% vivianite recovery within three passes. A concentrated P-product was produced with a vivianite content of up to 800 mg/g and a P content of 98 mg/g. P recovery is limited by the amount of P bound in vivianite and can be increased by increased iron dosing. With sufficient iron dosing, the vivianite content can be increased, and subsequently more P can be recovered. This would allow compliance with existing German legislation, which requires a P recovery larger than 50\%.},

Fertilizer technology employs different types of biosolids: sewage sludge, ashes from sewage sludge, agricultural residues, and food waste. Organo-mineral fertilizers can be formulated from different mass streams of biological origin: biomass processed by biological conversion (aerobic or anaerobic), chemical conditioning (acids or alkali), or thermal processes (combustion, pyrolysis). Through a combination of different types of processed biomass (e.g., biosolids conditioned with mineral acid can be neutralized and granulated with ashes from the biomass combustion) and by composition correction, it is possible to produce organic-mineral fertilizers. Particular attention was paid to relevant law (agriculture and non-agricultural applications) and technological problems such as large-scale installations. The available fertilizer production technologies constitute a part of the concept of bio-based circular economy, which in turn could lead to sustainable development as envisioned by the new European Green Deal strategy.},

Based on the mono-combustion of SS, magnesian minerals comprising of magnesium oxide were doped with SS to carry out the behavior of magnesium in phosphorous capture and its sensitivity to subsequent thermochemical modification. Five percent MgO improved phosphorous capture, and its effectiveness was disturbed by sulfur at 900 \&deg;C. The more H2O that was pumped into the atmosphere, the more phosphorous was captured by 5\% MgO. The capacity of MgO in phosphorous capture was inferior to that of CaO. The utilization efficiency of MgO for phosphorous capture was inferior to that of CaO. A total of 7.2\% MgO succeeded in recovering 97.46\% phosphorous with 5\% H2O at 900 \&deg;C. A total of 15.06\% hydromagnesite merely promoted 1.85\% and 5.13\% of the phosphorous relative enrichment factor (RE) in SS ashes without or with 5\% H2O, respectively, whereas it recovered 90.21\% phosphorous with 10\% H2O, supposing a potentiality in phosphorous capture for the direct combustion of wet SS. However, having been improved by magnesium, the bioavailability of phosphorous in SS ash remained extremely limited. Thus, thermal modification by K2CO3 was applied, where the limited bioavailability of phosphorous in the SS ashes was remarkably alleviated; although, SiO2 and sulfate were the main disturbers and led to the production of K2MgSiO4 and K2Mg2(SO4)3. The effective constituents were KMgPO4 and K3CaH(PO4)2 in the final mixed fertilizer. The obtained mixed fertilizer might be suitable for application on acidic soils.},

In this study, biochar was prepared by co-pyrolysis of SS and reed (Phragmites australis, RD) using a modified muffle furnace device under different temperatures (300, 500, and 700 °C) and with different mixing ratios (25, 50, and 75 wt.\% RD). The physicochemical properties of biochar and the transformation behaviors of phosphorus (P) and heavy metals during the co-pyrolysis process were studied. Compared with single SS pyrolysis, the biochar derived from SS-RD co-pyrolysis had lower yield and ash content, higher pH, C content, and aromatic structure. The addition of RD could reduce the total P content of biochar and promote the transformation from non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) to apatite phosphorus (AP). In addition, co-pyrolysis also reduced the content and toxicity of heavy metals in biochar. Therefore, co-pyrolysis could be a promising strategy to achieve the simultaneous treatment of SS and RD, as well as the production of value-added biochar.},

Current practice requires large inputs of energy, involves toxic intermediates, and generates substantial waste. Furthermore, a negligible fraction of phosphorus-containing waste is recycled which in turn contributes to negative environmental impacts, such as eutrophication. Methods that begin to address some of these drawbacks are reviewed, and some key opportunities to be realized by pursuing organophosphorus chemistry under the principles of Green Chemistry are highlighted.

	abstract = {Faecal sludge management is recognized globally as an essential component of city-wide inclusive sanitation. However, a major gap in developing appropriate and adequate management and monitoring for faecal sludge is the ability to understand and predict the characteristics and volumes of accumulated faecal sludge, and correlations to source populations. Since standard methods for sampling and analysing faecal sludge do not currently exist, results are not comparable, the actual variability is not yet fully understood, and the transfer of knowledge and data between different regions and institutions can be challenging and often arbitrary. Due to this lack of standard analytical methods for faecal sludge, methods from other fields, such as wastewater management, and soil and food science are frequently applied. However, these methods are not necessarily the most suitable for faecal sludge analysis, and have not been specifically adapted for this purpose. Characteristics of faecal sludge can be different than these other matrices by orders of magnitude. There is also a lack of standard methods for sampling, which is complicated by the difficult nature of in situ sampling, the wide range of onsite sanitation technologies and potential sampling locations, and the diverse heterogeneity of faecal sludge within onsite containments and within cities. This illustrates the urgent need to establish common methods and procedures for faecal sludge characterisation, quantification, sampling, and modelling. The aim of this book is to provide a basis for standardised methods for the analysis of faecal sludge from onsite sanitation technologies, for improved communication between sanitation practitioners, and for greater confidence in the generated data. The book presents background information on types of faecal sludge, methods for sample collection, health and safety procedures for handling, case studies of experimental design, an approach for estimating faecal sludge at community to city-wide scales, modelling containment and treatment processes, recipes for simulants, and laboratory methods for faecal sludge analysis currently in use by faecal sludge laboratories. This book will be beneficial for researchers, laboratory technicians, academics, students and sanitation practitioners.},

	volume = {20(7)},
	abstract = {Municipal wastewater generated by Canada's expanding population carries a significant load of the nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Improved scientific understanding and increasing public awareness of the adverse effects of nutrient overload in a watershed is putting pressure on municipalities to introduce or enhance treatment technologies that remove these nutrients from wastewater. Most conventional nutrient removal processes are energy-intensive and/or require the use of large amounts of chemicals, resulting in high greenhouse gas emissions. Municipalities are seeking processes that accomplish nutrient removal with minimal social impact, environmental impact and financial burden — a " triple bottom line " approach. Over the past two decades, researchers and practitioners around the world have introduced many improvements to conventional nutrient removal processes and developed new technologies. These include nitrogen removal processes with significantly reduced energy demand, as well as processes for recovery and reuse of water, nutrients and energy from wastewater. However, the adoption of these advancements varies, depending on the size and location of municipalities. In addition, some technologies have not been tested in a Canadian climate, leading to knowledge gaps in practice and regulations. This 2013-2015 project evaluated and interpreted current research and practice on nutrient removal and recovery to provide a knowledge base for the design, operation and regulation of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Canada. In order to identify a range of options for removal, recovery and reuse and analyze the extent to which these options can be applied in Canadian conditions, the project explored:},

Nutrient cycle sustainability and recycling approaches are important measures under development and considerations. This paper aims to present an overview of routes and technologies for nutrient recovery from sewage sludge and measures for improving their sustainability. First, current routes for nutrient recovery from sewage sludge are briefly reviewed. Next, an overview of commercial nutrient recovery technologies, projects, and emerging techniques around the world with the key factors for a successful phosphorus recovery technology is presented. Finally, a proposal for improving the sustainability of these practices is presented. It is concluded that the gap between demand and supply can be a major driver for the shift from ‘removal and treat’ to ‘recovery and reuse’. Moreover, there is not, and will never be, a one-size-fits-all solution. Future strategies and roadmaps need to be adapted to the local economy and geographical context more than ever.},

The objectives were to characterize the retention of major elements and trace metals within the sludge deposits particles under regular operating conditions, and the influence of extreme pH conditions on their potential release which may occur in situations when the plant malfunctions or after land application of the dredged sludge. A sequential extraction protocol was first used to assess the distribution of the elements within the sludge deposits. Results showed that most of Cu and Pb were associated to organic matter within the oxidizable fraction. Zn, Ni and Cd were distributed in several fractions, notably bound to Fe-Mn oxides and associated to organic matter. Cr was analyzed mostly in the residual fraction. Aliquot fractions of sludge deposits were also submitted to Acid and Base Neutralization Capacity tests (ANC-BNC) where the samples were suspended into acidic or alkaline aqueous solutions, and the solutions analyzed after 48 h contact time. Results showed a pH-dependent leaching profile for all monitored elements. The role of organic matter was observed for almost all metals. It was particularly dominant for Cu which was leached more extensively under alkaline than acidic conditions. Since Cu is not an amphoteric element, this leaching pattern was attributed to the leaching of organic matter which followed a similar pH-dependent profile than Cu. Spectrometric indices were used to characterize soluble organic compounds. Results showed that complex and humified dissolved organic compounds were mostly released under alkaline conditions.},

Its efficient recovery from sewage treatment plants is important to mitigate both dependence on limited reserves of exploitable phosphate rock and eutrophication of surface waters. Here, we evaluate the use of calcium silicate hydrates (CSH) to recover phosphorous eluted from sewage sludge. Phosphorous elution experiments were conducted with acid and base leaching solutions. The phosphorous recovery efficiency with CSH was compared to that with other calcium compounds, and the final product was analyzed to assess its potential value as fertilizer. Dried sewage sludge from the West Lake Ecological Water Resource Center, South Korea, having 123 g-P kg−1, was used for these tests. About 55\% of the phosphorus in the sludge was released with an elution solution of 0.1 M H2SO4. A dose of 15 g L−1 of CSH recovered 89.6\% of the eluted phosphorous without the need for additional pre-treatment, and the resulting calcium phosphate product (in brushite form, based on XRD analysis) exhibited superior settleability than that resulting from Ca(OH)2- and CaCl2-induced precipitation. XRD peaks of the calcium sulfate hydrate (in gypsum form) and residual CSH were also observed. The final product contained a relatively high content of the total P2O5 eluted in a 2\% citric acid solution (43.1\%), which suggests that it might be readily used to fertilize crops.},

Leaching sewage sludge with 1 M sulphuric acid at 5\% solid loading for 2 h resulted in an 82\% phosphorus extraction. However, the phosphorus was recovered as iron phosphates, thus a further purification step using ion exchange to remove iron was required to increase the degree of P release. Magnesium oxide and ammonium hydroxide were used as magnesium and nitrogen sources, respectively, as well as pH regulators to precipitate P as struvite. 57\% struvite was precipitated and the total phosphorus content of the precipitate was 25.9\%. Kinetic studies showed that the leaching of phosphorus follows the Dickinson model for the first 100 min with a rate of reaction of about 2 × 10−5 s−1. The rate limiting step is controlled by diffusion. Phosphorus solubility in 2\% critic acid was almost 96\%, which is the amount of phosphorus available to plants if the precipitate is applied as a fertiliser. Environmental, gram-positive Bacillus subtilis were found in the precipitate, which are harmless to the environment since they already exist in the soil where the precipitate can be applied as a fertiliser.},

This article focuses on how the composition of ash and sludge residues influences the extraction of phosphate and heavy metals and if different treatment temperatures of the sludge effect the leachability. Results showed that acid leaching gave a higher release of phosphate than alkaline leaching for all ash and sludge residue samples. Also, alkaline leaching dissolved phosphate with a lower metal contamination than acid leaching. Furthermore, it was found that iron had a low release at both alkaline and acid leaching from ash and from SCWO residue. The difference in composition of ash and sludge residue samples had no significant influence on release of phosphate at high concentrations of acid. Phosphate release from ash, dried sludge at 300°C and SCWO residue showed similar results at 1 M acid leaching. However, it seems to be easier to release phosphate from the SCWO residue than from the ash at low acid concentrations. SCWO residue showed higher release than the other ashes at 0.5 M HCl. Results for alkaline leaching showed higher release from ash at 1 M NaOH than from SCWO residue or from dried sludge at 300°C. The leaching of phosphate from dried sludge seems to be temperature dependent, as the dried sludge treated at higher temperature showed less release of phosphate. It was found that the pre-treatment of the ash may be important for better release of phosphate. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In order to obtain information about aluminum(III)-phosphate interactions, potentiometric measurements were carried out to characterize the complex forming properties of Al(III) with organic phosphates, phosphonates, and nucleoside-5′-monophosphates. The aluminum(III)-orthophosphate system is difficult to study due to AlPO 4 precipitation. To overcome this problem, the stability constant logarithms of the 1:1 Al(III) complexes of ligands with the same donor groups (log K 1:1) were plotted against the basicities of the ligands (log K PO3H). The resulting linear free energy relation (LFER) indicates that organic phosphates, phosphonates, and uridine-, thymidine-, and guanosine 5′-monophosphates similarly bind Al(III). Adenosine and cytidine 5′-monophosphate fall above the LFER owing to the presence of a second microform with the nucleic base protonated and a hydroxide bound to the Al(III). From the LFER the log stability constant for Al(III) binding to HPO 4 2-is estimated as 6.13 (0.05. From the weakness of any soluble orthophosphate complexes of Al(III) we confirm the importance of citrate as the main small molecule Al 3+ binder in the blood serum. The study includes investigation of Al(III) binding to di-and triphosphates, which bind metal ion differently than monophosphates. Structures of the complexes were supported by 31 P NMR measurements.},

Important progress was reported regarding the awareness of P as finite mineable resource, technologies to recycle P, and legislation towards a circular P economy. Yet, critical deficits were identified such as how to handle legacy P, how climate change may affect ecosystem P cycling, or working business models to up-scale existing recycling models. Workshop participants argued for more transdisciplinary networks to narrow a perceived science-practice/policy gap. While this gap may be smaller in reality as illustrated with a Swiss example, we formulate recommendations how to bridge this gap more effectively.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge (SS) incineration technology has become a primary method to recover and reuse SS, and the cocombustion with coal is a more feasible process due to the limited heating value of wet SS and the difficulty of drying SS. Being that phosphorus is a major element in SS, its migration during cocombustion with coal was unclear but vital. Phosphorus migration during the cocombustion of wet SS and various coals was investigated by drop tube furnace in this study. More phosphorus was fixed as apatite in ash by calcic and magnesian minerals at 1000 °C than at 800−900 °C. Calcium was taken up by sulfur in Tianchi coal (TC) and subsequently captured phosphorus ineffectively at 800 °C, while the competition of sulfur on calcium was alleviated over 900 °C. Silicic and aluminic minerals in Xiheishan coal (XHS) exhibited a good capacity for phosphorus capture at 800 °C. The outstanding calcic proportion in Xiaolongtan coal (XLT) created the highest rate of phosphorus fixation in ash, and the relative enrichment (RE) of phosphorus achieved up to 93.29\% at 1000 °C. Steam generally deteriorated phosphorus capture at 1000 °C. For SS cocombustion with XHS, the effect of sulfur was alleviated by steam, and the impact of steam was mainly caused by Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 OH. For SS cocombustion with TC or XLT, 10\% steam still hindered phosphorus capture, while 5\% steam promoted phosphorus capture. The RE of phosphorus in ash was positively correlated with coal content and increased from 69.64\% with 30\% XLT to 93.29\% with 70\% XLT. TC and XHS hindered phosphorus fixation in ash, and their content hardly affected the RE of phosphorus.},

By combining the oxygen carrier gasification technology and microwave heating, an absorbing oxygen carrier (AOC) is used in this study to successfully induce phosphorus enrichment in sludge char. The AOC, which is based on iron and supported on SiC, has been prepared via ultrasonic impregnation. The effects of preparation conditions (particle size of SiC and loading of iron) on the phosphorus enrichment characteristics, thermal reaction performance of the AOC and sludge, and the wave absorption performance of the AOC were investigated. The results show that the AOC prepared using a SiC particle size of 36 mesh and iron loading of 10\% can achieve a phosphorus enrichment of 91.30\% in the sludge char when the temperature of the microwave reactor is 600 • C. In the thermal reaction test, AOC can effectively increase the rate and depth of sludge gasification reaction in the medium-and high-temperature reaction stages. Iron-based is loading on the SiC surface and has a good wave absorption performance (RL =-16.28 dB; effective absorption width is 3.54 GHz). Overall, this study provides a new and effective approach for utilizing sludge.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a novel calcium oxide-enhanced phosphorus recycling technique using sewage sludge degradative solvent extraction. We investigated the effects of extraction parameters such as the temperature, holding time, and sludge/extractant ratio on the soluble yield and phosphorus distribution in the residue. The enhancement mechanisms of the apatite phosphorus (AP) content after adding CaO for degradative solvent extraction were also studied. The results showed that the effective separation of organic matter and phosphorus enrichment were simultaneously achieved. An increase in the extraction factors promoted the extraction of organic matter. The peak soluble yield is 13.30 g/100 gSS which was obtained at extraction temperature of 300 • C, holding time of 60 min and sludge/extractant ratio of 100/300 g/mL. The soluble matter with high amounts of volatile matter and near-zero ash content has high-value utilization potential. After the degradative solvent extraction, almost all P in the sewage sludge was enriched in the residue. The organic phosphorus (OP) in the residue almost disappeared, and the proportion of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) increased. As the amount of added CaO increased from 0 to 10 g, the proportions of AP in TP increased from 36.55 to 80.15\%, while that of NAIP decreased from 61.93 to 14.77\%. The transformation of P from OP to the inorganic species during extraction was promoted by the addition of CaO, particularly for the formation of hydroxylapatite.},

In this work, the distribution of 19 elements in bottom and cyclone ashes from pilot-scale grate furnace have been monitored to determine the suitability for the phosphorus acid extraction. Moreover, the inﬂuence of some parameters beyond wet chemical leaching conditions were investigated. Experimental results showed that bottom ash presented lower contamination in comparison to cyclone ash and low co-dissolution of heavy metals (especially Cr, Pb and Ni), while high phosphorus extraction efﬁciencies (76–86\%) were achieved. High Al content in the bottom ash (9.4\%) negatively affected the phosphorus extraction efﬁciency as well as loss on ignition, while the particle size reduction was necessary for ensuring a suitable contact surface. The typology of precipitating agents did not strongly affect the phosphorus precipitation, while pH was the key parameter. At pH 3.5–5, phosphorus precipitation efﬁciencies higher than 90\% were achieved, with a mean phosphorus content in the recovered material equal to 16–17\%, comparable to commercial fertilizers. Instead, the co-precipitation of Fe and Al had a detrimental effect on the recovered material, indicating the need for additional treatments.},

In this review, we analyse different methods of sewage sludge treatment in terms of potential environmental risk and raw materials recovery. The review begins with a comparison and assessment of existing reviews on this topic. Then, it focuses on the properties and current utilisation of sewage sludge in agriculture and a brief description of sludge thermal treatment methods (mono- and co-incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification). The final part of the review is devoted to technologies for treating sludge ash from mono-incinerators to recover phosphorus, a substance listed as a critical raw material by the EU. Our results show that direct use of sewage sludge likewise composts containing sewage sludge should no longer be considered as a direct source of nutrients and organic matter in agriculture, because of its pollutant content. Co-incineration and landfilling represent a dead-end in sludge treatment due to the loss of raw materials, whereas pyrolysis is sustainable for remote lo­ cations with low heavy metal content sludge. Heavy metals also pose a problem for the direct use of sludge ash and must be therefore removed. There are already sludge ash processing technologies that are capable of pro­ cessing ash to form a variety of raw materials such as phosphorus. These regeneration approaches are currently in their infancy, but are gradually being introduced. The sewage sludge treatment industry is rapidly evolving, and we have attempted to summarise and discuss the current state of knowledge in this review, which will provide a baseline towards the future of sewage sludge suitable treatment.},

Aluminum and selected heavy metal fractionation was carried out in the post-coagulation sludge collected at a water treatment plant (where aluminum was used as a coagulant), fermented sewage sludge at a municipal wastewater treatment plant (which did not apply aluminum coagulant), and soil from water treatment plant as well as the mixtures of sludge and soil. It has been found that post-coagulation sludge used as natural fertilizer is a secondary source of bioavailable aluminum, especially when aluminum coagulants are used during water and wastewater treatment. The evaluation of applicability of the sludge to very weak acidic and acidic agricultural soils was carried out. The authors shall debate the question whether, in this case, the Regulation of EU and Polish Government on sewage sludge should also take the bioavailable aluminum into account and add to the list of the elements whose allowable contents are limited.},

Here, we investigated the speciation evolution of P and S in SSB induced by ageing processes in soil using X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. Results showed that Ca-bound compounds like hydroxyapatite dominated the P forms, while over 60\% of S existed as reduced inorganic sulﬁdes in the SSB. The stable Ca-associated P species in SSB tended to be transformed gradually into relatively soluble species during ageing in soil. The speciation composition of S in SSB remained almost unaﬀected when aged in pot soils, whereas about 33.6\% of reduced sulﬁdes were transformed into oxidized species after 1-year ageing in ﬁeld soils. SSB signiﬁcantly increased the proportion of sulﬁdes and the contents of available P and S in the amended soil but showed relatively weak eﬀects on the speciation distribution of P in the soil because of their similar compositions. These ﬁndings provide insights into biogeochemistry of nutrients and behaviors of heavy metals in SSB after its application to the soil environments.},

	abstract = {The effects of catalytic hydrothermal (HT) pretreatment on animal manure followed by the addition of hydrochar on the nutrients recovery have not yet been investigated using a combination of chemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques. Therefore, a catalytic HT process was employed to pretreat swine manure without additives (manure-HT) and with H2O2 addition (manure-HT- H2O2) to improve the conversion efficiency of labile or organic phosphorus (P) to inorganic phase. Then, a Ca–Al layered double hydroxide hydrochar (Ca/Al LDH@HC) derived from corn cob biomass was synthesized and applied to enhance P sorption. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (3D-EEM), X-ray photoelectron spectros­ copy (XPS), P k-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), were used to elucidate the mechanisms of P release and capture. The H2O2 assisted HT treatment significantly enhanced the release of inorganic P (251.4 mg/L) as compared to the untreated manure (57.2 mg/L). The 3D-EEM analysis indicated that the labile or organic P was transformed and solubilized efficiently along with the deconstruction of manure components after the H2O2 assisted HT pretreatment. Application of Ca/Al LDH@HC improved the removal efficiency of P from the derived P-rich HT liquid. This sorption process was conformed to the pseudo-second-order model, suggesting that chemisorption was the primary mechanism. The results of SEM and P k-edge XANES exhibited that Ca, as the dominated metal component, could act as a reaction site for the formation of phosphate precipitation. These results provide critical findings about recovering P from manure waste, which is useful for biowastes manage­ ment and nutrients utilization, and mitigating unintended P loss and potential environmental risks.},

	abstract = {Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) is a specialized technique used to provide information about the geographic, chemical, and biological origins of substances. The ability to determine the source of an organic substance stems from the relative isotopic abundances of the elements which comprise the material. Because the isotope ratios of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen can become locally enriched or depleted through a variety of kinetic and thermodynamic factors, measurement of the isotope ratios can be used to differentiate between samples which otherwise share identical chemical compositions. Several sample introduction methods are now available for commercial isotope ratio mass spectrometers. Combustion is most commonly used for bulk isotopic analysis, whereas gas and liquid chromatography are predominately used for the real-time isotopic analysis of specific compounds within a mixture. Here, highlights of advances in instrumentation and applications within the last three years are provided to illustrate the impact of this rapidly growing area of research. Some prominent new applications include authenticating organic food produce, ascertaining whether or not African elephants are guilty of night-time raids on farmers' crops, and linking forensic drug and soil samples from a crime scene to a suspected point of origin. For the sake of brevity, we focus this Minireview on the isotope ratio measurements of lighter-elements common to organic sources; we do not cover the equally important field of inorganic isotope ratio mass spectrometry.},

	abstract = {Magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to investigate the chemical environment of P in soil and soil components. 31P and 27Al MAS NMR spectra are presented of synthetic aluminium hydroxides (amorphous aluminium hydroxide and gibbsite), reacted with P under different conditions of P concentration, temperature and pH. The reaction product is amorphous octahedral aluminium phosphate, which transforms (partly reversibly) to tetrahedral aluminium phosphate upon drying. Results of several experiments on excessively fertilized sandy soil material are discussed. The soil particle fraction smaller than 50 μm was used for NMR analysis. 31P and 27Al MAS NMR spectra show a CaP pool and an AlP pool. A six-fold water extraction removes part of both P pools. Oxalate extraction removes all CaP and AlP from the sample. Removal of the labile P pool by the HFO-DMT long-term P desorption technique, does not drastically change the 31P MAS NMR spectrum. The formerly mentioned CaP and AlP are thus stable P pools. The 1H31P cross-polarization (CP) spectrum of the original soil sample revealed a third chemical environment, which was identified as labile CaP: this P pool does not appear in the 1H31P CP spectrum of the soil sample from which the fast P pool had been removed. The combination of MAS and CP MAS NMR can thus reveal at least three different P species in soil, of which two pools were identified as stable, and one as labile.},

	abstract = {Water contaminated with phosphorus needs to be managed efficiently to ensure that clean water sources will be preserved. Aquaculture plays an essential role in supplying food and generating high revenue. However, the quantity of phosphorus released from aquaculture effluents is among the major concerns for the environment. Phosphorus is a non-renewable, spatially concentrated material essential for global food production. Phosphorus is also known as a primary source of eutrophication. Hence, phosphorus recovery and separation from different wastewater streams are mandatory. This paper reviews the source of phosphorus in the environment, focusing on aquaculture wastewater as a precursor for hydroxyapatite formation evaluates the research progress on maximizing phosphorus removal from aquaculture wastewater effluents and converting it into a conversion. Shrimp shell waste appears to be an essential resource for manufacturing high-value chemicals, given current trends in wealth creation from waste. Shrimp shell waste is the richest source of calcium carbonate and has been used to produce hydroxyapatite after proper treatment is reviewed. There have been significant attempts to create safe and long-term solutions for the disposal of shrimp shell debris. Through the discussion, the optimum condition of the method, the source of phosphorus, and the calcium are the factors that influence the formation of hydroxyapatite as a pioneer in zero-waste management for sustainability and profitable approach. This review will provide comprehensive documentation on resource utilization and product development from aquaculture wastewater and waste to achieve a zero-waste approach.},

This paper presents the performance of fertilizer (AF) and biofertilizer (BF) from sewage sludge ash and animal blood under field conditions. BF is AF incorporated with lyophilized cells of P-solubilizing bacteria, Bacillus megaterium. In the experiments with spring or winter wheat, the biobased fertilizers were compared to commercial P fertilizer, superphosphate (SP). No P fertilization provided an additional reference. Fertilizer effects on wheat productivity and on selected properties of soil were studied. BF showed the same yield-forming efficiency as SP, and under poorer habitat conditions, performed slightly better than AF in increasing yield and soil available P. Biobased fertilizers applied at the P rate up to 35.2 kg ha–1 did not affect the soil pH, did not increase As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb content, and did not alter the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria and fungi in the soil. The findings indicate that biobased fertilizers could at least partially replace conventional P fertilizers. Research into strain selection and the proportion of P-solubilizing microorganisms introduced into fertilizers should be continued.},

	abstract = {The recovery of phosphorus is so far limited to recovering phosphorus as struvite or vivianite from the supernatant of digester, but this process is not economically viable. In this study, a biofilm reactor was operated to directly enrich phosphorus from sewage to investigate whether phosphorus harvest affected the phosphorus uptake/release of phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) and evaluated the potential of phosphorus recovery from concentrated liquid. The results showed that phosphorus was quickly released in the new recirculated solution by PAOs with saturated poly-phosphate after phosphorus harvest, which promoted the synthesis or degradation of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and glycogen in PAOs, restoring its ability to absorb phosphorus. Although the results of crystallization experiments demonstrated that there were traces of K-struvite and Na-struvite ({\textless}0.1wt.\%) in precipitate, the simultaneous precipitation of compounds could not significantly affect the purity of products. Using the concentrated solution with a phosphorus concentration of 168.5 ± 2.7mg·L−1 as phosphorus source for struvite precipitation achieved phosphorus recovery efficiency of 74.5-95.8\% and obtained struvite crystals with a size of 83.5-114.3 μm, whereas the quantity of fine products ({\textless}10 μm) was rised due to an increase in saturation. Especially, the highest phosphorus recovery efficiency (95.8 ± 3.2\%) was obtained at pH=8.5 and Mg: P=1.5. Moreover, life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis indicated that the CO2 equivalent emission of struvite production was 0.64-1.01kg CO2 equivalent/kg struvite, and the phosphorus recovery efficiency and environmental impact could be balanced at pH=8.5 and Mg: P=1.5:1.},

	abstract = {Under arid and semi-arid conditions, direct application of phosphate rock (PR) as a source of phosphorus (P) for crop production is likely influenced by agricultural practices and soil properties. Different approaches could be used to improve the agronomic efficiency of low-grade PR over a wider range of soils and crops. In this study, biological, physical, and chemical treatments of low-grade Moroccan PR were investigated and compared through agronomic trials on faba bean grown under alkaline soil conditions. The physical treatment was based on blending PR with triple superphosphate (TSP) at 75:25 and 50:50 ratios, the biological treatments involved co-application of PR with compost at 50:50 ratio and phospho-compost elaborated from PR (20\%), sewage sludge (46\%), and wheat residues (34\%), while the chemical treatment was obtained by a 30\% acidulation of PR by phosphoric acid. Control treatments consisting of zero P application (control), PR alone, and TSP alone were considered to assess the effectiveness of the abovementioned techniques to improve PR agronomic efficiency. A pot experiment was conducted in sandy soil (Jorf Lasfar, central Morocco) for 60 days in a completely randomized design considering eight treatments. All treatments, except the control, were amended with 52 mg kg−1 of P from different PR-based fertilizers before sowing. At the flowering stage (60-day-old plants), results indicated that all PR treatments significantly improved plant growth, root nodulation, and nutrient uptake compared to the control. The relative agronomic efficiency of pretreated PR was significantly higher with phospho-compost treatment (86\%) than the partially acidulated PR (78\%) or the PR/TSP blend 50:50 (64\%). Likewise, P uptake, P use efficiency, number of root nodules, and N uptake all were improved under PR treatments. Our finding revealed that the biological technique based on phospho-compost yielded better compared to chemical and physical treatments.},

The WWTPs combine chemical P removal (CPR) and enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) and were compared to understand the effect of iron (Fe) dosing with and without codosing of aluminum (Al) and thermal hydrolysis on the P speciation. 31P NMR showed comparable inorganic orthophosphate (ortho-P, 53–60\% of total P) and organophosphate (organic-P, 37–45\%) in primary sludge, whereas polyphosphate (poly-P, 23–44\%) from poly-P accumulating organisms (PAOs) was mainly observed in the secondary sludge. Inorganic ortho-P (90–98\%) dominated after anaerobic digestion, which degraded poly-P and most organic-P. The inorganic ortho-P was mainly Fe bound P (Fe-P), especially after anaerobic digestion (71\%). Codosing of Fe and Al led to two comparable fractions: Fe-P (38\%) and P sorbed on amorphous Al (hydr)oxides (38\%). Vivianite was identified in all samples by microscopy and chemical extraction but was PXRD amorphous in 12 out of 17 samples. Thus, vivianite may be more common in sewage sludge than previously known.},

Ion-exchange methods using both carbonate/hydrogencarbonate and hydroxide selective columns in combination with self-regenerating membrane and solid-phase-based suppressors enable determination of phosphate down to ppb levels. New technology, particularly on-line electrolytic hydroxide generators and electrolytic self-regenerating suppressor devices, has allowed the use of elution gradients in both carbonate/hydrogencarbonate and hydroxide selective systems, improving sensitivity and reducing total analysis time for samples containing phosphate together with other inorganic anions. In addition to a review of these developments, optimization and application of chromatographic methods using reversed stationary phases and cationic and/or zwitterionic surfactants is also discussed. The objective of most of the IC methods developed for phosphorus species is the determination of phosphate and total phosphorus. Therefore, sample treatment and separation conditions specifically developed for this purpose are also described. In addition, application of IC to the analysis of other inorganic (reduced and condensed) and organic (phytates, alkyl phosphate, and phosphonates) phosphorus species is discussed along with methodology and relevant applications in water analysis and other miscellaneous fields.},

	abstract = {Precipitation of mineral phosphates from wastewater treatment processes is an excellent method for phosphorus recovery, leading to the formation of compounds with high fertilizing value. Conventionally, P-precipitation processes are mostly applied to supernatant of anaerobic sludge digestates, due to their high P and N residual contents. This study concerns P-recovery in a pilot-scale side-stream reactor from aerobic (activated sludge) wastewater liquor. The effect of process retention time and pH was determined using sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide as alternative pH buffer reagents, in both synthetic and real wastewater. Equilibrium mass balance calculations were first applied to estimate the theoretical final composition of P-precipitates under different process conditions; then, actual precipitation experiments were carried out with synthetic wastewater to define optimal process operating parameters in controlled conditions. Results showed that phosphorus precipitation was affected mainly by solution pH and did not significantly depend on the reactor’s retention time. These findings were validated by operating the process with real wastewater: on average, 61.2\% and 90.4\% phosphorus precipitation (recovery) were achieved at pH = 8.5 and 9.0 under a controlled Mg:NH4:P molar ratio of 5:5:1, using sodium hydroxide as acidity buffer. The main fraction of final precipitates consisted of calcium phosphate compounds, while struvite, bobierrite and calcite showed up in smaller proportions. It was also shown that dosage of calcium hydroxide for pH adjustment, without any other chemicals for molar ratios adjustment of the solution, has great potential for P recovery in the form of a calcium phosphate-rich precipitate, usable for fertilizer, with 75.6\% phosphorus removal in mineral form at pH = 8.5. The process is much less costly to operate than struvite precipitation, and more energetically sustainable. This scheme could be ideally suited for application in facilities operating under an enhanced phosphorus removal process scheme.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus is one of the most important macronutrients needed for the growth of plants. The fertilizer production market uses 80\% of natural, non-renewable phosphorus resources in the form of phosphate rock. The depletion of those deposits forces a search for other alternatives, including biological waste. This review aims to indicate the most important ways to recover phosphorus from biowaste, with particular emphasis on wastewater, sewage sludge, manure, slaughter or food waste. A comparison of utilized methods and directions for future research based on the latest research is presented. Combining biological, chemical, and physical methods with thermal treatment appears to be the most effective way for the treatment of wastewater sludge in terms of phosphorus recovery. Hydrothermal, thermochemical, and adsorption on thermally treated adsorbents are characterized by a high phosphorus recovery rate (over 95\%). For animal byproducts and other biological waste, chemical methods seems to be the most optimal solution with a recovery rate over 96\%. Due to its large volume and relatively low phosphorus content, wastewater is a resource that requires additional treatment to recover the highest possible amount of phosphorus. Pretreatment of wastewater with combined methods seems to be a possible way to improve phosphorus recovery. A compressive evaluation of combined methods is crucial for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {Unsafe disposal of faecal sludge from onsite sanitation in low-income countries has detrimental effects on public health and the environment. The production of biochar from faecal sludge offers complete destruction of pathogens and a value-added treatment product. To date, research has been limited to the laboratory. This study evaluates the biochars produced from the co-treatment of faecal sludge from septic tanks and agricultural waste at two full-scale treatment plants in India by determining their physical and chemical properties to establish their potential applications. The process yielded macroporous, powdery biochars that can be utilised for soil amendment or energy recovery. Average calorific values reaching 14.9 MJ/kg suggest use as solid fuel, but are limited by a high ash content. Phosphorus and potassium are enriched in the biochar but their concentrations are restricted by the nutrient-depleted nature of septic tank faecal sludge. High concentrations of calcium and magnesium led to a liming potential of up to 20.1\% calcium carbonate equivalents, indicating suitability for use on acidic soils. Heavy metals present in faecal sludge were concentrated in the biochar and compliance for soil application will depend on local regulations. Nevertheless, heavy metal mobility was considerably reduced, especially for Cu and Zn, by 51.2–65.2\% and 48.6–59.6\% respectively. Co-treatment of faecal sludge with other carbon-rich waste streams can be used to influence desired biochar properties. In this case, the addition of agricultural waste increased nutrient and fixed carbon concentrations, as well as providing an additional source of energy. This study is a proof of concept for biochar production achieving full-scale faecal sludge treatment. The findings will help inform appropriate use of the treatment products as this technology becomes more commonly applied.},

It has long been treated as “waste”, while landfill is its major final disposal destination. In fact, AlS is an underutilized material with huge potential for beneficial reuse as a raw material in various wastewater treatment processes. In the last two decades, intensive studies have been conducted worldwide to explore the “science” and practical application of AlS. This paper focuses on the recent developments in the use of AlS that show its strong potential for reuse in wastewater treatment processes. In particular, the review covers the key “science” of the nature and mechanisms of AlS, revealing why AlS has the potential to be a value-added material. In addition, the future focus of research towards the widespread application of AlS as a raw material/product in commercial markets is suggested, which expands the scope for AlS research and development.},

The unified scale is designed to provide a precise ratio, Ξ, of the resonance frequency of a given nuclide to that of the primary reference, the 1H resonance of tetramethylsilane (TMS) in dilute solution (volume fraction, ϕ{\textless}1\%) in chloroform. Referencing procedures are discussed, including matters of practical application of the unified scale. Special attention is paid to recommended reference samples, and values of Ξ for secondary references on the unified scale are listed, many of which are the results of new measurements. Some earlier recommendations relating to the reporting of chemical shifts are endorsed. The chemical shift, δ, is redefined to avoid previous ambiguities but to leave practical usage unchanged. Relations between the unified scale and recently published recommendations for referencing in aqueous solutions (for specific use in biochemical work) are discussed, as well as the special effects of working in the solid state with magic-angle spinning. In all, nine new recommendations relating to chemical shifts are made. Standardised nuclear spin data are also presented in tabular form for the stable (and some unstable) isotopes of all elements with non-zero quantum numbers. The information given includes quantum numbers, isotopic abundances, magnetic moments, magnetogyric ratios, and receptivities, together with quadrupole moments and line-width factors (where appropriate).},

We first present updated correlations between 1H chemical shift and O⋯O and H⋯O distances of O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, derived from a comprehensive 1H chemical shift database containing both original high-quality fast magic angle spinning (MAS) and two-dimensional combined rotation and multiple pulse spectroscopy (CRAMPS)-MAS NMR data and literature MAS NMR data for a large number of inorganic compounds, including phosphates, silicates, (oxy)hydroxides, borates, sulfates, and carbonates. These correlations may be used to estimate hydrogen-bonding distances for inorganic oxide materials of unknown structures. We then present case studies for the application of high-resolution two-dimensional 1H CRAMPS-MAS NMR to unravel the order/disorder of proton distributions in crystalline high-pressure hydrous silicates. Finally, we summarize some of our results on the water speciation in hydrous (alumino)silicate glasses of a range of compositions obtained through comprehensive 1H MAS NMR, and 29Si–1H and 27Al–1H double-resonance NMR experiments, and analyze them in the framework of a quasi-chemical model.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) plays essential roles in crops growth. Natural mineral sources of phosphate are non-renewable, overexploited and unevenly distributed worldwide, making P a strategic resource for agricultural systems. The search for sustainable ways to secure P supply for fertilizer production has therefore become a critical issue worldwide. Sewage sludge (SS) is an organic waste material considered as a key alternative source of P. Switzerland and the European Union are about to make it mandatory to recover P from SS or its treatment residues. Among the many technical options to achieve this objective, SS thermochemical treatments spiked with Cl-donors appear as a promising approach to recover P from SS and separate it from mineral pollutants such as trace metal elements (TME). The purpose of Cl-donor additives is to fix P within the mineral residues, possibly in bioavailable P species forms, while promoting TME vaporization by chlorination mechanisms. This review paper compares the various thermochemical treatments investigated worldwide over the past two decades. The influence of process conditions and Cl-donor nature is discussed. The presented results show that, except for nickel and chromium, most TME can be significantly vaporized during a high temperature treatment (over 900 °C) with Cl addition. In addition, the fixation rate and solubility of P is increased when a Cl-donor such as MgCl2 is added.},

	abstract = {Conversion of organic waste into engineered metal-biochar composite is an effective way of enhancing biochar’s efficiency for adsorptive capture of phosphorus (P) from aqueous media. Thus, various strategies have been created for the production of metal-biochar composites; however, the complex preparation steps, high-cost metal salt reagent application, or extreme process equipment requirements involved in those strategies limited the large-scale production of metal-biochar composites. In this study, a novel biochar composite rich in magnesium oxides (MFBC) was directly produced through co-pyrolysis of magnesite with food waste; the product, MFBC was used to adsorptively capture P from solution and bio-liquid wastewater. The results showed that compared to the pristine food waste biochar, MFBC was a uniformly hybrid MgO biochar composite with a P capture capacity of 523.91 mg/g. The capture of P by MFBC was fitted using the Langmuir and pseudo-first-order kinetic models. The P adsorptive capture was controlled by MgHPO4 formation and electrostatic attraction, which was affected by the coexisting F− and CO32− ions. MFBC could recover more than 98\% of P from the solution and bio-liquid wastewater. Although the P-adsorbed MFBC showed very limited reusability but it can be substituted for phosphate fertiliser in agricultural practices. This study provided an innovative technology for preparing MgO-biochar composite against P recovery from aqueous media, and also highlighted high-value-added approaches for resource utilization of bio-liquid wastewater and food waste.},

	abstract = {Sustainable phosphorus (P) recovery from sewage sludge is crucial to reconciling the simultaneous shortage and excess of P. In this study, magnetic biochar (MBC) was synthesized and innovatively applied to enhance P recovery as vivianite. The effects of anaerobic digestion (AD) time, hydrothermal (HT) pretreatment temperature and MBC dose on vivianite formation were investigated using batch experiments and a modified sequential P extraction protocol. The P fractionation results showed that the concentration of pure vivianite-bound P (Fe(II)-P) reached a maximum on the 10th day of AD treatment, and then declined sharply due to vivianite oxidation and P limitation. HT pretreatment operated at relatively high temperatures (135 and 185 °C) reduced vivianite formation; this negative effect of HT pretreatment was partially compensated by MBC supplementation. The proportion of Fe(II)-P in the solid phase of sludge was substantially raised up to 57.1\% from 8.3{\textasciitilde}17.4\% with an increasing dose of MBC from 0 to 12.5 g/L, indicating that MBC had a markedly enhanced effect on vivianite formation; this could be attributed to the MBC-improved Fe(II) production, as evidenced by the elevated proportion of Fe(II) in Fe2p XPS spectra and the increased ratio of Fe(II)-P to oxidized vivianite-bound P (Fe(III)-P) in the sludge after MBC supplementation. MBC addition also decreased the proportion of water-extractable P by sorption and promoted organic P decomposition, which further facilitated vivianite production. These findings reveal a new strategy for enhancing P recovery from HT-pretreated AD sludge.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge management for fertilizer purposes can be a step in the circular phosphorus (P) economy. Using microbial solubilization in manufacturing fertilizers from recycled materials is an innovative approach with the potential to increase P compounds’ bioavailability, and fertilizers from sewage sludge ash and P-solubilizing bacteria are promising products of this technology. In addition to P and a range of macronutrients, these fertilizers contain small amounts of micronutrients and potentially toxic elements. This paper discusses the effects of fertilizer on iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) content in soil, test plants (spring or winter wheat; grain and straw), weeds and post-harvest residues, based on field experiments. Treatments with conventional P fertilizers (superphosphate, phosphorite) and without P fertilization provided references. The tested biofertilizers containing the Bacillus megaterium or Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strain had no effect on total Fe and Al content in the soil or on the concentration of these elements in plant biomass when applied at P doses up to 35.2 kg ha–1. Fe and Al levels in grain did not suggest a potential risk to consumers.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) recovery from incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) has been extensively investigated, but insufficient research has been conducted to evaluate the effect of different kinds of recovered phosphate fertilizers (RPFs) on plant growth with respect to the P and heavy metal contents of RPFs. In this study, three kinds of RPFs, precipitated calcium phosphate fertilizer (CaP), struvite phosphate fertilizer (SP), and P-loaded biochar (BP), produced from ISSA were characterized, and their agronomic effectiveness was verified by hydroponic and soil cultivation. In addition to the three kinds of RPFs, a control group (mono-phosphate fertilizer in hydroponic group/compound fertilizer in soil cultivation group) and a blank control group (BC, with zero P) were tested on choy sum and ryegrass at the same time. SP has the highest P purity (76.0\% of struvite) while the BP has the most complex P species (P was co-exist with Fe, Al, and Mg). Plant growth results showed that the RPFs greatly facilitated plant growth and demonstrated superior/comparable effects to those of control group. In hydroponics testing, SP showed the best effect (shoot length of 17.0 cm, chlorophyll content of 2.05 mg/g) due to the Mg involved and the high P purity of SP, while BP performed the best (shoot length of 13.7 cm, chlorophyll content of 2.42 mg/g) in the soil testing system among all of the groups because of the additional nutritional elements and the high P availability of BP. Additionally, the accumulation of heavy metals in the plants under all conditions did not exceed the limits stipulated in the regulations. These results indicate that recovering P from ISSA is an attractive technology to produce P fertilizers, which can alleviate both the scarcity of phosphate resources and the burden of ISSA management.

	abstract = {The introduction of the anaerobic digestion for the treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is currently of special interest. The main difficulty in the treatment of this waste fraction is its biotransformation, due to the complexity of organic material. Therefore, the first step must be its physical, chemical and biological pretreatment for breaking complex molecules into simple monomers, to increase solubilization of organic material and improve the efficiency of the anaerobic treatment in the second step. This paper describes chemical pretreatment based on lime addition (Ca(OH)2), in order to enhance chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization, followed by anaerobic digestion of the OFMSW. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in completely mixed reactors, 1L capacity. Optimal conditions for COD solubilization in the first step of pretreatment were 62.0mEq Ca(OH)2/L for 6.0h. Under these conditions, 11.5\% of the COD was solubilized. The anaerobic digestion efficiency of the OFMSW, with and without pretreatment, was evaluated. The highest methane yield under anaerobic digestion of the pretreated waste was 0.15m3CH4/kg volatile solids (VS), 172.0\% of the control. Under that condition the soluble COD and VS removal were 93.0\% and 94.0\%, respectively. The results have shown that chemical pretreatment with lime, followed by anaerobic digestion, provides the best results for stabilizing the OFMSW.},

The ecological toxicity of HMs was greatly reduced, and all HMs exhibited their lowest risk levels after HTC at 220 °C for 1 h in 2\% H2SO4 solution. Most of the P ({\textasciitilde} 97\%) in the input sludge remained in the hydrochar after HTC. HTC facilitated transformation of organic P to inorganic P and promoted conversion of apatite P to non-apatite inorganic P under acidic conditions.

Inspired by tree diagrams that illustrate diversity of products stemming from raw materials, we present here the Green ChemisTREE as a showcase for the diversity of research and achievements stemming from Green Chemistry. Each branch of the Green ChemisTREE represents one of the 12 Principles, and the leaves represent areas of inquiry and development relevant to that Principle (branch). As such, in this ‘meta-review’, we aim to describe the history and current status of the field of Green Chemistry: by exploring activity within each Principle, by summarizing the benefits of Green Chemistry through robust examples, by discussing tools and metrics available to measure progress towards Green Chemistry, and by outlining knowledge gaps, opportunities, and future challenges for the field.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus is a nutrient that is essential to nature and human life and has attracted attention because of its very limited reserves. Dwindling phosphorus reserves and soaring prices have made the recovery of phosphorus from waste biosolids even more urgent. Waste activated sludge, as the final destination of most of the phosphorus in human domestic and industrial water, has been considered as a reliable source of phosphorus recovery. The thermal treatment method of sewage sludge is currently a relatively environmentally friendly disposal method, which mainly includes incineration, pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization. This paper reviews the methods for the recovery of different forms of phosphorus (wet chemical, thermochemical and electrodialysis) from solid products obtained from different sludge thermal treatment methods (incinerated sewage sludge ash, pyrolysis of sewage sludge char and hydrochar) and the bioavailability of the recovered phosphorus products. Incineration of sewage sludge is currently the most established and effective method for recovering phosphorus from the thermal treatment products of sewage sludge. One of the wet chemical methods has been applied on a commercial scale and is expected to be further developed for future industrial applications. Pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonation still have many research gaps in this field. Based on their principles and laboratory performance, both of them have the potential to recover phosphorus and should be further explored.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a necessary element for plant growth and animal health. Most P utilized by anthropogenic activities is released within the generation of various solid wastes such as sewage sludge, animal manure, and wetland plant, which increase the risk of water contamination. (Hydro)thermal treatment could be employed for solid waste treatment with the production of value-added hydro/bio-char, and the behavior of P during the thermochemical treatment process is critical for the further utilization of hydro/bio-char. This study provides a systematic review of the migration and transformation mechanisms of P during thermochemical treatment of various solid wastes, and special emphasis is given to the potential applications of P-enriched hydro/bio-char. Future challenges and perspectives in the thermal treatment of P-enriched solid waste are presented as well. The distribution and speciation of P were affected by feedstock properties, thermal technique, and reaction conditions, correspondingly affecting hydro/bio-char applications. The derived P-enriched hydro/bio-char was mainly applied as an agricultural soil amendment, P recovery source, and heavy metal sorbent, which could be adjusted by varying treatment process parameters. Additionally, potentially toxic substances, such as heavy metals in the solid waste, should be addressed during the production and application of hydro/bio-char. Overall, the production of P-enriched hydro/bio-char from solid waste is a promising route to simultaneously achieve P reclamation and solid waste treatment.},

This study investigates the fate of phosphate during the hydrothermal carbonization of digested sewage sludge to support the development of an economic and sustainable solution for dealing with sewage sludge for phosphate recovery. The solid products from the hydrothermal carbonization of digested sewage sludge in a batch reactor (180, 220, and 260 °C; 1, 2, and 4 h; digested sewage sludge-to-water ratios of 0.2 and 0.1 w/w) were analyzed using a sequential chemical extraction procedure to understand and predict the formation of phosphate species and the related extraction behavior of phosphate. The obtained results were compared with the thermochemical equilibrium composition of hydrothermal carbonization products, calculated using the software FactSage 7.2. The majority of phosphate was retained as Al, Ca, and Fe salts in hydrochar. The decomposition of organic phosphates was observed by processing at lower temperatures. Hydrothermal carbonization at temperatures higher than 180 °C resulted in the transformation of the Al-bound phosphate into Ca-bound phosphate. Hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)) and Fe7(PO4)6 were calculated as stable phosphate-containing minerals at equilibrium. This study suggests that kinetic constraints inhibit the formation of these minerals in the batch reactor and presents a mechanism of phosphate transformation using the obtained data. The results allow for targeted optimization of phosphate recovery strategy.},

Reference treatments with water-soluble P added at equal amounts of total P were included. The transfer of P from SSACa and SSAMg to Lolium multiflorum or P pools of sequentially extracted soil-fertilizer incubations were quantified.
Results The shoot P uptake from SSAMg was higher than from SSACa. For SSAMg the relative effectiveness compared to a water-soluble P fertilizer was 88 \% on an acidic and 71 \% on a neutral soil but only 4 \% on an alkaline soil. The proportion of P derived from the fertilizer in the plant and in the first two extraction pools of soil-fertilizer incubations were strongly correlated, suggesting that it is sufficient to conduct an incubation study to obtain robust information on plant P availability.
Conclusions We conclude that under acidic to neutral conditions SSAMg presents an appropriate alternative to conventional P fertilizers and the dissolution of P from SSAMg seems to be governed by protons and cations in the soil solution.},

              The scarcity of phosphate ores and increasing water eutrophication are driving economically attractive and environment-friendly approaches for phosphorus recovery. The biomass thermochemical conversion process enables effective protection against water eutrophication caused by phosphorus loss, while allowing the remediation of water eutrophication. This review focuses on the main reaction processes for phosphorus recovery from phosphorus-rich biomass (
              e.g.
              , sewage sludge and food waste) as secondary phosphorus sources through biomass thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis – pyrochar, hydrothermal – hydrochar, and hydrothermal humification – artificial humic substances). Also, revealing the contribution mechanisms (ligand exchange, electrostatic attraction, and surface precipitation) of phosphate adsorption on metal-modified high-carbon containing lignocellulosic biomass (

              , crop straw and fruit shells) thermochemical transformation products. This review provides insight on the possibility, superiority, and extensiveness for the prevention and remediation of water eutrophication through biomass thermochemical conversion, and contributes to the further development and application of phosphorus recovery.},

	abstract = {With increasing energy and resource consumption due to population growth, the biorefinery concept is becoming popular. This concept aims to harness all the properties of biomass by producing energy and recovering useful chemical products. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus play a key role in the world’s food production because they are the main elements used in fertilizer production. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has been presented as a suitable option for energy recovery that can also be used as a pre-treatment for enhanced nutrient recovery. During the HTC process, part of the nitrogen and phosphorus are solubilized into the process water and the other part remains within the hydrochar. Hydrochars are mainly used as soil amendments due to their high content of phosphorus and nitrogen, but in this process, water still contains a considerable concentration of these compounds making it a potential source for their recovery. Therefore, HTC may boost the nutrient recovery strategy by extraction (process water) or densification (hydrochar) from biomass if it is coupled with another nutrient recovery process. This review presents an overview of the phosphorus and nitrogen fate during the HTC process from a perspective of nutrient recovery, presenting existing technologies and future trends.},

	abstract = {We report the self-assembly of an extensive inter-ligand hydrogen-bonding network of octylphosphonates on the surface of cesium lead bromide nanocrystals (CsPbBr3 NCs). The post-synthetic addition of octylphosphonic acid to oleic acid/oleylamine-capped CsPbBr3 NCs promoted the attachment of octylphosphonate to the NC surface, while the remaining oleylammonium ligands maintained the high dispersability of the NCs in non-polar solvent. Through powerful 2D solid-state 31P–1H NMR, we demonstrated that an ethyl acetate/acetonitrile purification regime was crucial for initiating the self-assembly of extensive octylphosphonate chains. Octylphosphonate ligands were found to preferentially bind in a monodentate mode through P–O−, leaving polar PO and P–OH groups free to form inter-ligand hydrogen bonds. The octylphosphonate ligand network strongly passivated the nanocrystal surface, yielding a fully-purified CsPbBr3 NC ink with PLQY of 62\%, over 3 times higher than untreated NCs. We translated this to LED devices, achieving maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance of 7.74\% and 1022 cd m−2 with OPA treatment, as opposed to 3.59\% and 229 cd m−2 for untreated CsPbBr3 NCs. This represents one of the highest efficiency LEDs obtained for all-inorganic CsPbBr3 NCs, accomplished through simple, effective passivation and purification processes. The robust binding of octylphosphonates to the perovskite lattice, and specifically their ability to interlink through hydrogen bonding, offers a promising passivation approach which could potentially be beneficial across a breadth of halide perovskite optoelectronic applications.},

To advance the understanding of sorption reactions, development of new methodology is required. In this study, we applied novel 31P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the mechanism of phosphate sorption on aluminum hydroxides under different environmental conditions, including pH (4–10), concentration (0.1–10 mM), ionic strength (0.001–0.5 M), and reaction time (15 min–22 days). Under these conditions, the NMR results suggest formation of bidentate binuclear inner-sphere surface complexes was the dominant mechanism. However, it was found that surface wetting caused a small difference. A small amount ({\textless}3\%) of monodentate mononuclear inner-sphere surface complexes was observed in addition to the majority of bidentate binuclear surface complexes on a wet paste sample prepared at pH 5, which was analyzed in situ by a double-resonance NMR technique, namely, 31P\{27Al\} rotational echo adiabatic passage double resonance (REAPDOR). Additionally, we found that adsorbents can substantially impact phosphate sorption not only on the macroscopic sorption capacity but also on their 31P NMR spectra. Very similar NMR peaks were observed for phosphate sorbed to gibbsite and bayerite, whereas the spectra for phosphate adsorbed to boehmite, corundum, and γ-alumina were significantly different. All of these measurements reveal that NMR spectroscopy is a useful analytical tool for studying phosphorus chemistry at environmental interfaces.},

	abstract = {The mineral forms of phosphorus in three urban sewage sludges were characterized using high-resolution solid-state phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) coupled to a sequential extraction. The sludges studied were an anaerobically-digested and heat-treated sludge (Paris-Achères), an activated sludge (Briare) and an anaerobically-digested sludge (Nancy). NMR observations were conducted using both single-pulse and cross-polarization sequences in order to distinguish between 31P nuclei far from 1H nuclei, and 31P located within a fraction of a nanometre of 1H. This approach showed that a complex mixture of P species was present in these sludges. A mixture of hydrogenated octocalcium phosphates and apatites was observed in the three samples. Monetite was present in the anaerobically-digested sludge and brushite in the activated sludge. Dehydrogenated condensed calcium phosphates (compounds with a Ca:P ratio higher than 1.0 such as fluorapatite or tricalcium phosphate) and dehydrogenated pyrophosphates were also probably present in the anaerobically-digested sludge. A poorly-ordered wavellite was observed in the three sludges after the HCl extraction. However, results were inconclusive as to whether this mineral was present in the three sludges, or had been precipitated during the sequential extraction.},

	abstract = {Background: Maintaining the balance of phosphorus in ecosystems is a priority activity in environmental protection. To achieve this successfully, it is necessary to know the physicochemical properties of phosphorus forms. Objective: Speciation analysis is used for this purpose. This process helps to assess the concentration of various physical and chemical forms of phosphorus. When there are very unstable chemical forms of the analyte hindering the determination in the environmental test, fractionation is performed, i.e., the process of classifying the analyte or a group of analytes from a given sample according to physical properties. Methods and Results: The paper discusses the phosphorus fractionation methods in environmental samples. The authors critically analyzed over a dozen phosphorus fractionation procedures using sequential extraction of this element. Particular attention was paid to the possibility of sequential extraction when determining the phosphorus pool available to plants (bioavailable fraction) and labile phosphorus able to migrate in the environment. The paper discusses examples of phosphorus fractionation in various environmental matrices, such as river and lake sediments, sewage sludge, composts, and soils. The selection of an appropriate method for the studied environment was made. Conclusions: Adapting the proposed methodology to the environmental matrix being tested determines the most accurate results of the experiment. Attention was also paid to the possibilities of practical applications of fractionation results, particularly the possibility of isolating phosphorus available for plants from various environmental matrices.},

	abstract = {Biomass is a promising renewable source that can reduce fossil fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions, but some of its characteristics make it difficult to use in its raw form. Torrefaction has been proposed as a thermochemical pretreatment to upgrade biomass for direct applications such as combustion and gasification, biochar and chemicals production, while reducing its transportation cost and increasing its shelf-life. Research, development, and demonstration of biomass torrefaction technologies have advanced during the last few decades, but many science and engineering fundamentals as well as technological challenges remain, especially in the areas of reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, reactor models and design, large-scale implementation, and environmental performance. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of recent developments in biomass torrefaction research and technology focusing on kinetics, particle and reactor scale models, and reactor designs. The impacts of torrefaction as a pretreatment of biomass on subsequent conversion processes, and the novel applications of torrefied biomass are discussed. The energy management, environmental impacts, economic and market potential of the technology as well as the deployment options are also addressed. There is no best universal torrefaction reactor and hence the choice should be made based on the biomass feedstock and the expected production rate and application. To reduce process costs and competition with other uses of biomass, the utilization of either waste or environmentally sustainable, more abundant, and faster growing biomass should be targeted for this technology. Torrefied biomass produced at higher temperatures resemble pyrolysis biochar in several properties thereby making it suitable for most biochar applications. Finally, considering the need to identify the bottlenecks that potentially could limit the use of torrefaction, and its preceding or subsequent processes, the future prospects, challenges, and opportunities of torrefaction technology are presented.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus recycling from sewage sludge will be obligatory in Germany from 2029. Phosphorus content determination in sewage sludge is crucial to assess the prescribed recycling rates. Currently, German law regards sample preparation using aqua regia digestion in a microwave or under reflux conditions as well as instrumental phosphorus determination by ICP-OES, ICP-MS, or photometric determination with ammonium molybdate as equivalent. However, it is questionable whether these methods are indeed equivalent regarding phosphorus quantification in sludges near the limit of 20 g/kg for mandatory recycling. To answer this question, 15 sewage sludges of 11 different wastewater treatment plants were investigated with all permitted method (digestion and measurement) combinations. Moreover, one sewage sludge was also examined in an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) with 28 participants. This study shows that the above-mentioned methods differ in some cases significantly but across all method combinations and sludges, phosphorus recovery was between 80 and 121\% after normalization to the grand mean (average of 15 sludges between 85 and 111\%). The ILC and the examination of 15 sludges produced largely similar results. There is a tendency to higher phosphorus recovery after microwave digestion compared to reflux digestion and ICP-OES measurements determine higher phosphorus contents than ICP-MS and photometric phosphorus determination. As a result, the authors recommend ICP-OES determination of phosphorus in sewage sludge after microwave digestion.},

Groups of batch experiments were designed and conducted to explore the efficiencies of P extraction using different acids (HCl, HNO3 and H2SO4) and bases (NaOH and KOH). The results showed that either acid or base is efficient for P extraction and the efficiency relied mainly on the concentrations of H+/OH−, not the type of acid or base. Considering the efficiency, price and safety of the acids and bases tested, H2SO4 was chosen as most suitable reagent for P extraction. A Box–Behnken experimental design based on the response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the optimum of H2SO4 extraction. The optimal condition for the mass of sludge, H2SO4 concentration and volume was 0.8 g, 0.063 M and 142 ml, respectively. At such optimal condition, the maximum P extraction efficiency of 98.2\% was achieved. Additionally, most of the main components of the saturated sludge, such as metals (Al, Ca, Mg and Fe), TOC (total organic carbon) and nitrogen can also be extracted. Overall, the results supported that H2SO4 seems to be an efficient and cost-effective reagent among all the reagents tested for P-saturated alum sludge treatment.},

The mechanism of phosphate-alkali-directed regulation and transformation was discussed and analysed with batch hydrothermal treatment experiments and characterizations such as XRD and SEM. The obtained results showed that DOPC degradation was divided into two periods, i.e., the initial accumulation of phosphorus-containing precursors with increasing temperature, followed by complete degradation to H3PO4 as treatment continued. In addition, compared with the activation of P by NaOH, Ca(OH)2 is more favourable for the stabilization of P and the migration of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) to apatite inorganic phosphorus (AP). The pH and appropriate feed Ca/P molar ratio during HC determine the degree to which total phosphorus is converted to Ca-bound P. The findings reveal the mechanism of phosphate-alkali-directed regulation and transformation and provide a theoretical reference for the efficient treatment of phosphorus-containing waste and the alkali-directed production of high-phosphorus bioavailability products.},

	abstract = {Sludge phosphorus (P) recovery is an effective method for alleviating P depletion. This study presents a convenient hydrothermal (HT) treatment step before the pyrolysis of sewage sludge to improve biochar-P availability. The results demonstrate that sludge P can be stabilized during this HT treatment process. The biochar-P availability decreased gradually as the HT treatment temperature increased from 130 to 280 ◦C. The biochar-P release behavior indicated that a considerable portion of fast-release P was present in the biochar pyrolyzed from sludge when pretreated with the HT process. The environmental conditions (i.e., environmental pH, ionic strength of the solution, and low-molecular-weight acids) had almost negligible effects on the biochar-P release behavior. The seed germination rate was improved from 40\% without adding biochar to 73.3\% with the addition of biochar pyrolyzed from sludge with prepyrolysis HT treatment at 130 ◦C. The environmental impact was minimized by HT treatment of the sludge at 160 ◦C for 1 h according to the results of the comparative life cycle assessment of various P recovery alternatives. As shown in the present study, the prepyrolysis HT treatment of sludge at 160 ◦C for 1 h potentially represents a promising P recovery strategy by improving biochar-P availability.},

Recently, recovering P as value-added vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O) has aroused great interest due to the convenient process operation, high recovery efficiency, and wide applications of vivianite. In this review, qualitative and quantitative detection methods of vivianite have been first analyzed, providing reference to test vivianite content and purity. Advanced technologies for P enrichment and vivianite production, including ion exchange, electrodialysis, capacitive de-ionization, membrane bioreactor, anaerobic fermentation, chemical precipitation, electrochemical crystallization, biomineralization, and anaerobic digestion are then comprehensively summarized. Mechanisms and representative applications of each technique are emphasized. Also, critical parameters (e.g., pH, Fe/P molar ratio, sulfate concentration, microorganisms, supersaturation index, organic matters, and seed crystals) affecting vivianite formation have been systematically analyzed. Furthermore, perspectives regarding fast detection of vivianite, strategies optimization, seed application, and vivianite commercialization have been proposed to guide the development of next-generation techniques for P recovery. This review is expected to provide fundamental insights into cleaner technologies synchronous recovering waste P and producing valued vivianite, as well as to stimulate future studies on circular economy-driven wastewater management.},

	abstract = {Fungal extraction is a promising approach for reclaiming phosphorus (P) from sewage sludge ash (SSA). However, this approach faces notable technical and economic challenges, including an unknown P speciation evolution and the addition of expensive chemical organic carbon. In this study, the use of an organic-rich effluent produced in sludge dewatering as nutrient source is proposed to initiate the fungal extraction of SSA-borne P with Aspergillus niger. The changes in P speciation in the ash during fungal treatment was analyzed by combined sequential extraction, solid-state 31P nuclear magnetic resonance, and P X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy. Results showed that after 5 days of fungal treatment using sludge-derived organics, 85 \% of P was leached from SSA. Dominantly, this considerable release of P resulted from the dissolution of Ca3(PO4)2, AlPO4, FePO4, and Mg3(PO4)2 in the ash, and their individual contribution rates to P released accounted for 28.0 \%, 24.3 \%, 20.6 \%, and 18.8 \%, respectively. After removal of metal cations (e.g., Mg2+, Al3+, Fe3+, and heavy metals) by cation exchange resin (CER), a hydroxyapatite (HAP) product with a purity of {\textgreater} 85 \% was harvested from the extract by precipitation with CaCl2. By contrast, without CER purification, a crude product of Ca/Mg-carbonates and phosphates mixture were obtained from this extract. A total of 73.2 wt\% of P was ultimately recovered from SSA through integrated fungal extraction, CER purification, and HAP crystallization. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the development of waste management strategies for improved P reclamation with minimal chemical organics consumption.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential element to produce feed and fertilizers but also a non-renewable resource. Both the predicted exhaustion of phosphatic rocks and the risk of eutrophication lead to an increasing necessity of P recovery methodologies to be applied in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). One of the most promising solutions involves the precipitation of P-based minerals reusable as slow-release fertilizers. In this study, P recovery as struvite and hydroxyapatite from a municipal WWTP digestate liquid fraction (centrate) was investigated at varying pH (8-10), reagent typologies (MgCl2, NaOH, Ca(OH)2, CaCl2) and concentrations under limiting magnesium doses through liquid- and solid-phase analyses and thermodynamical modelling. A maximum P recovery of 87.3\% was achieved at pH = 9 by adding NaOH and a MgCl2 dose of 656 mg/L (the higher tested). According to this data, it was estimated that 92.0 tons/year of struvite and 33.2 tons/year of hydroxyapatite could be recovered from the WWTP centrate with a cost for reagent consumption being almost 50\% of the mean P market value. An increase of P precipitation was observed when comparing experiments with same pH values but higher Mg2+ dose. Ca2+ addition led to extensive P precipitation but mainly as amorphous phases that interfere with struvite formation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

Economic P recycling can contribute to sustainable P management and lessen the pressure on P imports of the EU. Several European countries now have paved the way for establishing P recovery legislation and successively implemented compulsory recycling from P-rich wastes. This paper provided a comprehensive review for analyzing the potential of existing P recycling resources and engineering technologies in terms of their feasibility and applicability in Europe. Potential P-rich flows from the waste streams and eutrophic environments were deeply investigated. Regarding their technical principles, application, and availability, different engineering approaches for P release enhancement and P recovery were also reviewed in a critical manner. Moreover, assessments on engineering applications for P recycling considering economic feasibility and environmental benefits were also presented. Wastewater treatment plants show promising recovery efficiency, whereas industrial processes with sludge ashes as input allow up to 95\% recovery of P. Collectively, in Europe, efficient and sustainable management of P has been recognized as a necessary strategy to meet the growing demand for mineral P.},

However, there are some problems such as high ash content and low nutrient recovery of products. Since the HTC of corn cob (CC) showed excellent N-fixation effect, the co-hydrothermal carbonization (co-HTC) of two typical agroforestry and livestock wastes, namely swine manure (SM) and CC, to prepare organic fertilizers was proposed. The effects of reaction temperature, residence time, and raw materials composition on hydrochar yield, total nutrient content (TNC) and nutrient elements distribution in co-HTC were investigated. Results showed that compared to SM and SM-derived hydrochars, the Co-hydrochars derived from co-HTC of SM and CC exhibited better fertilizer potentials due to the synergistic effects such as Maillard reaction between raw materials components. Under the optimal hydrothermal conditions of 240 °C, 120 min, and mixing ratio of 1:1, the Co-hydrochar showed the best fertility with TNC of 6.341 \%, nitrogen (N) recovery of 47.61 \% and phosphorus (P) recovery of 86.41 \%. Meanwhile, the co-HTC treatment could reduce the phytotoxicity and inhibitory effect for seed germination. Moreover, an appropriate extension of residence time (from 60 min to 120 min) was conducive to the migration of N into the hydrochar. The hydrochars derived from co-HTC were also rich in medium-microelements such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe) etc., which played good roles in fixing P in hydrochars.},

By leaching in molten CaCl2, PO43- in the ash can be set free and electrochemically split into elemental phosphorus and O2−. We identify two technical advantages of using sewage sludge ash. Metal cations released from the ash boost the leaching rate of PO43−, while SiO2 in the ash prevents the accumulation of O2- in the melt. Electrochemical isolation can keep most impurities in phosphorus within 1.00 ppm, far better than the industrialgrade commercial product. The estimated cost is less than 2 USD (kg-P)−1.

	abstract = {The presently increasing global population demands increased food production. Consequently, phosphate – an indispensable fertilizer component – will be needed in ever greater amounts. Current levels of mining of phosphate’s most important constituent element, phosphorus (P), are unsustainable, and P rock is predicted to soon be completely depleted. Because P is a non-renewable resource, techniques to recover and reuse waste phosphate are necessary. Large amounts of unused phosphate exist in both municipal and agricultural wastewater streams, as well as in sewage sludge. Approaches to recovering phosphate from these sources fall into three main categories: biological, chemical, and electrochemical. Biological phosphate recovery has seen some plant-scale use, but significant drawbacks including the complication of operation have prevented it from becoming widespread. The most common method of phosphate recovery, chemical phosphate recovery, has been applied at scale with success due to the stability and reliability of the process. However, disadvantages such as the exorbitant amounts of alkali dosing required to maintain the high pH necessary for phosphate precipitation leave room for improvement. In recent years, electrochemical phosphate recovery has gained traction because of its potential to overcome the weaknesses of traditional chemical approaches by utilizing water electrolysis to induce a high pH without the need for an added base. But before plant-scale electrochemical methods can be considered economically viable, the steep energy requirements of water electrolysis must be mitigated through the development of improved electrocatalysts or circumvented through the discovery and application of new electrochemical processes to generate hydroxyl ions needed to induce a high pH. In this review, the three broad categories of phosphate recovery techniques are discussed and an outlook on the future of electrocatalysis for phosphate recovery is presented. Particularly, the requirements for improved and Earth-abundant electrocatalysts are considered alongside a critical discussion of the possibility of a decentralized network of onsite wastewater treatment facilities powered by renewable electricity.},

To address this drawback, a magnetic sewage sludge-derived biochar (MSBC-2) was synthesized by a solvent-free method in this study. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model provided the best fit to the experimental data, implying a monolayered chemisorption process of Pb2+, Cd2+and Cu2+ onto MSBC-2. As the reaction temperature increased from 25 °C to 45 °C, the maximum adsorption capacities increased from 113.64 mg·g−1 to 151.52 mg·g−1 for Pb2+, from 101.01 mg·g−1 to 109.89 mg·g−1 for Cd2+ and from 57.80 mg·g−1 to 74.07 mg·g−1 for Cu2+, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔG0 {\textless} 0, ΔS0 {\textgreater} 0, ΔH0 {\textgreater} 0) revealed that the adsorption processes of all three metals by MSBC-2 were favourable, spontaneous and endothermic. Surface complexation, cation-π interaction, ion exchange and electrostatic attraction mechanisms were involved in the adsorption of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Cu2+ onto MSBC-2. Overall, this study will provide a new perspective for the synthesis of magnetic biochar and MSBC-2 shows great potential as an adsorbent for heavy metal removal.},

	abstract = {Marine pollution caused by the untreated and substandard discharge of ship domestic sewage has received widespread attention. A novel integrated process for struvite recovery and nutrient removal from ship domestic sewage (SRNR-SDS) based on seawater magnesium source was developed in this study. Removal efficiencies of the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for the activated sludge unit in SRNR-SDS process were approximately 67.61\% and 41.35\%, respectively, under the salinity of 7.85 g/L. The coupling-induced struvite crystallization unit significantly improved the removal efficiency of TN and TP, and the scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction demonstrated that magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) crystals were successfully formed on the surface of zeolite. The SRNR-SDS process had an ideal performance for pollutant removal and MAP recovery under the optimal hydraulic retention time of 20 h. The effluent concentrations of COD, NH4+-N, TN and TP in SRNR-SDS process were approximately 34.73 mg/L, 4.31 mg/L, 10.07 mg/L and 0.23 mg/L, respectively, which meet the Chinese and international ship sewage discharge standards. SRNR-SDS process has obvious environmental, social and economic benefits, which could save 6.20\%∼57.14\% of the operation cost of ship domestic sewage treatment via MAP recovery. The results could provide theoretical and technical support for the development and application of ship sewage treatment process with the functions of pollutant removal and resource recovery.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication and the predicted limited future availability of rock phosphate has triggered the increased development of phosphorus (P) recovery technologies, however, for remote regions, recovery solutions are still limited. Here, we report on a novel pilot-scale technology (FILTRAFLOTM-P reactor) to recover phosphate (PO43−) from wastewater effluent through a filtration/adsorption process in a rural setting. This unit employs enhanced gravitational filtration through adsorption media (here, a novel KOH deacetylated crab carapace based chitosan-calcite material (CCM)) with continuous self-backwashing. Trials were designed to assess how the FILTRAFLOTM-P unit would operate under ‘real’ conditions (both at low and high PO43− levels), and to ascertain the effectiveness of the adsorbent to recover phosphate from final effluent. High removal was achieved at low phosphate concentrations, bringing the residual effluent PO43− level below 1 mg/L (EU limit for sensitive water bodies), while phosphate was efficiently harvested (at more than 50\%) at higher PO43− levels. Surface microprecipitation and inner-sphere complexation were postulated as the main PO43− adsorption mechanisms through XRD, XPS and EDX elemental mapping. Further, a quality assessment of the P-enriched CCM (which could be used as a potential soil amendment) was undertaken to consider elemental composition, microbiological assessment and quantification of organic micropollutants. Quality analysis indicated ∼2.5\% P2O5 present, trace levels (well below legislative limits) of heavy metals and extremely low levels of organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs, pharmaceuticals). No detectable levels of target bacterial pathogens were observed. Pot trials showed that ryegrass cultivated with the addition of the CCM adsorbent achieved higher plant dry matter and P concentration when compared to unfertilised controls, with a slow-release kinetic pattern. This study showed that CCM used with the FILTRAFLOTM-P pilot reactor has high potential to recover phosphate from effluents and encourage resource recovery via bio-based management of waste.},

In this study, investment and operational costs for nine P recovery processes were calculated from the investor's perspective, taking into account all relevant side effects on the sludge treatment or the wastewater treatment plant. The assessment was based on pilot and full-scale data which were thoroughly consolidated and standardized with technical and cost data from the German wastewater–sludge treatment train to enable direct comparison. The cost influence of precipitation processes on the current wastewater–sludge treatment train ranges from −0.14 (generating profit) to 0.23 EUR per population equivalent (PE) and year, while the cost influence of sludge leaching processes is around 2.50 EUR/(PE y). The cost influence of processes using dry sludge and mono-incineration ash varies between 0.33 and 3.13 EUR/(PE y), depending on existing disposal pathways, mono-incineration, co-incineration or agricultural use of sludge. The specific costs per kg P recovered (−4 to 10 EUR/kg P) are in general higher than conventional fertilizer production (1.6 EUR/kg P). However, annual costs per PE represent less than 3\% of the total costs for wastewater disposal.},

	abstract = {Sugarcane bagasse is commonly combusted to generate energy. Unfortunately, recycling strategies rarely consider the resulting ash as a potential fertilizer. To evaluate this recycling strategy for a sustainable circular economy, we characterized bagasse ash as a fertilizer and measured the effects of co-gasification and co-combustion of bagasse with either chicken manure or sewage sludge: on the phosphorus (P) mass fraction, P-extractability, and mineral P phases. Furthermore, we investigated the ashes as fertilizer for soybeans under greenhouse conditions. All methods in combination are reliable indicators helping to assess and predict P availability from ashes to soybeans. The fertilizer efficiency of pure bagasse ash increased with the ash amount supplied to the substrate. Nevertheless, it was not as effective as fertilization with triple-superphosphate and K2SO4, which we attributed to lower P availability. Co-gasification and co-combustion increased the P mass fraction in all bagasse-based ashes, but its extractability and availability to soybeans increased only when co-processed with chicken manure, because it enabled the formation of readily available Ca-alkali phosphates. Therefore, we recommend co-combusting biomass with alkali-rich residues to increase the availability of P from the ash to plants.},

We link P pools to P species and estimate the turnover times for commonly considered P pools. Dissolved P turned over in seconds, resin-extractable P in minutes, NaOH-extractable inorganic P in weeks to months, and HCl-extractable P in years to millennia. Furthermore, we show that in arid-zone soils, some primary mineral P remains even after 150 ky of soil development, whereas in humid-zone soils of the same age, all P in all pools has been biologically cycled. The integrative information we provide makes possible a more dynamic, process-oriented conceptual model of P cycling in soils.},

In this study, an innovative method for the recovery of P from WAS via pH adjustment-enhanced anaerobic fermentation (AF) and vivianite crystallization was developed. The results indicate that P could be effectively released from WAS to the supernatant under an appropriate pH during AF. P release efficiency increased by 31.6 \% at pH 5.0 and 26.1 \% at pH 11.0 compared to the control. Over 99 \% of the P in the liquid could be recovered by subsequent vivianite crystallization, and ∼60 \% total P recovery efficiency was obtained. The scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the co-precipitation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ affected vivianite purity. The recovered vivianite purity from the pH 11.0 supernatant (91.39 \%) was higher than the pH 5.0 supernatant (85.44 \%) because of lower Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in the former. In addition, the heavy metals in the recovered vivianite were lower than their own risk thresholds. This study provides new insights into the recovery of P from WAS by pH adjustment-enhanced AF and vivianite crystallization.},

Recently, various thermal processes for P-recovery have been developed, but there is still a demand for information on the effect of different process parameters (e.g. additives and temperature) on P-speciation and especially on the fertilization performance. In the present study, two common methods (low-temperature conversion at 400–500°C and thermochemical treatment at 950°C) were investigated and combined to produce highly bioavailable P-fertilizers from two different types of sewage sludge based on chemical phosphorus precipitation (Chem-P) and enhanced biological phosphorus removal (Bio-P). The results of P-fractionation, X-ray diffraction analysis, and pot experiments with maize showed that Bio-P sludges attain high P-plant-availability after treatment at low temperatures (400°C). In contrast, Chem-P sludges can adequately be treated at higher temperatures under reductive conditions with sodium additives to form highly bioavailable calcium-sodium-phosphate. Additionally, also highly heavy-metal contaminated sludges can be thermochemically treated at high temperatures to achieve the legal requirements for fertilizers.},

	abstract = {To prevent eutrophication of surface water, phosphate needs to be removed from sewage. Iron (Fe) dosing is commonly used to achieve this goal either as the main strategy or in support of biological removal. Vivianite (Fe(II)3(PO4)2 * 8H2O) plays a crucial role in capturing the phosphate, and if enough iron is present in the sludge after anaerobic digestion, 70–90\% of total phosphorus (P) can be bound in vivianite. Based on its paramagnetism and inspired by technologies used in the mining industry, a magnetic separation procedure has been developed. Two digested sludges from sewage treatment plants using Chemical Phosphorus Removal were processed with a lab-scale Jones magnetic separator with an emphasis on the characterization of the recovered vivianite and the P-rich caustic solution. The recovered fractions were analyzed with various analytical techniques (e.g., ICP-OES, TG-DSC-MS, XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy). The magnetic separation showed a concentration factor for phosphorus and iron of 2–3. The separated fractions consist of 52–62\% of vivianite, 20\% of organic matter, less than 10\% of quartz and a small quantity of siderite. More than 80\% of the P in the recovered vivianite mixture can be released and thus recovered via an alkaline treatment while the resulting iron oxide has the potential to be reused. Moreover, the trace elements in the P-rich caustic solution meet the future legislation for recovered phosphorus salts and are comparable to the usual content in Phosphate rock. The efficiency of the magnetic separation and the advantages of its implementation in WWTP are also discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, phosphorus (P) recovery from sewage sludge liquors gained much interest for its high-quality product potential. However, the consistently reported constraints are the low phosphorus availability and the technical-economical difficulties to increase it through chemical acidification. This article discusses the mechanisms of phosphorus dissolution by the biological acidification process (Biological acidification or acidic fermentation) as an alternative to chemical acidification. In addition, we investigate the potential correlation between the phosphorus dissolution and iron phosphate speciation of several types of sludge from different sewage treatment plants and P removal technologies. The results show that the percentage of P dissolution by bioacidification is always higher than the P dissolution by chemical acidification at equal pH for all types of sludge except for the settled primary sludge. The highest P dissolution was recorded for the sludge from the Enhanced Biological P Removal process assisted with Chemical P Removal process (EBPR-CPR) with around 65\% of P dissolution. Three mechanisms were identified as contributing to the increased P dissolution by bioacidification: P release by the Polyphosphate Accumulating Organisms (PAO), P dissolution by pH decrease, and P dissolution by a biological activity at acidic pH (3.7–4) that includes iron reduction and aluminum dissolution. The principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation indicate that P dissolution by bioacidification is negatively correlated with the P-bound to ferric iron, hence positively correlated with the P-bound to ferrous iron, which characterizes the sludge from the EBPR-CPR process. This study suggests that the choice of the P removal technology significantly influences the P recovery from sewage sludge liquors.},

	abstract = {Accurate identification of phosphorus (P) forms is crucially important for understanding the geochemical cycle of P; however, until now the role of ferrous iron P (Fe(II)-P) buried in sediments has been completely ignored in nearly all sequential extraction procedures developed. Using sediment cores sampled from Donghu Lake in Wuhan, China, this study explored a modified version of widely used sequential P extraction method (SEDEX; Ruttenberg, 1992) in which Fe(II)-P was identified as an independent fraction. Based on the high selectivity of the extractant (0.2\% 2,2′–bipyridine+0.1 M KCl) and the dissolution equilibrium of P, procedures for extracting Fe(II)-P were optimized using a 1:100 solid:liquid ratio and extraction at 50 ± 1 °C for 24 h. The sedimentary P extracted was divided into five fractions: loosely-bound P, Fe(II)-P, CDB-P, Ca-P and O-P. Fe(II)-P was the predominant fraction in fresh sediments in Donghu Lake, accounting for 15.7–49.9\% of TP, with a mean of 31.6\%. The mean values of Ca-P, O-P, CDB-P and loosely-bound P were 28.4\%, 22.7\%, 17.1\% and 4.3\%, respectively. Combined with component analysis of extracts and recovery experiments of standard reference minerals (vivianite, Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O) in natural sediments, extraction of Fe(II)-P with 0.2\% 2,2-bipridine and 0.1 M KCl was robust, with a good recovery rate (88.7–100.6\%) and little of the Ca-P dissolved. It is possible to use this innovative SEDEX not only to distinguish the contribution of different P matrices in fresh sediments, but also to investigate the transformation of sedimentary P under different redox conditions. Therefore, greater focus on Fe(II)-P is necessary, because it is a major sink for the geochemical process of sedimentary P.},

extracted in P{\textasciitilde}NaOH and P{\textasciitilde}BD' respectively.
Sediment treated with A12(S04)3 in the laboratory study showed an increase in P{\textasciitilde}NaOH (from 0.53 to 0.9 mg
g-l) and a correspondingly decrease in P{\textasciitilde}BD (from 0.6 to 0.25 mg g-l), probably due to inactivation of Fe by formation

	abstract = {The recovery of sludge produced in the wastewater treatment process in WWTPs is often limited by the high content of toxic forms of contaminants of both an inorganic and organic nature. One of the options for the effective treatment of the world’s ever-increasing quantities of sewage sludge is the pyrolysis process. Thermochemical conversion of sewage sludge is emerging as a promising method for treating these heterogeneous and highly complex wastes with increasing research work. Pyrolysis-treated sewage sludge (PM) prepared at 603–615 °C was characterized by pH, EC, and CHN-S analysis; total and bioavailable concentrations of P and heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe and Zn); fractionation of bound forms of P and heavy metals in the material and determination of the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The studied material was subjected to ecotoxicological tests (Daphnia pulex L.) and cultivation tests (Lactuca sativa L.). Elemental analysis revealed the concentrations of heavy metals in PM: Fe (137,600 mg/kg), Zn (2602 mg/kg), Cu (582 mg/kg), Cr (107 mg/kg), Pb (87 mg/kg), Ni (67 mg/kg), As ({\textless}1 mg/kg), Hg ({\textless}2 mg/kg) and Cd ({\textless}1 mg/kg). The highest values of extractability of the investigated heavy metals from PM were found in the cases of Zn (HCl) and Fe (Mehlich 3), both values not exceeding 500 mg/kg. BCR sequential extraction showed the major concentrations of Cu and Fe were predominantly bound in the residual fraction (F4) and Zn in the reducible fraction (F2) of PM. The results of heavy metal bioavailability suggest that the addition of PM does not negatively affect the growth of lettuce biomass and the metal contents of plant tissues. Based on the results obtained, the pyrolysis material prepared from municipal sewage sludge seems to be a promising and innovative soil additive and a potential alternative to conventional inorganic fertilizers.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is indispensable nutrient in agriculture, essential for nutrition of mankind. To close the P loop, P must be recovered during wastewater treatment in Germany by the end of this decade. Other EU countries will follow with similar regulations. As part of an Interreg NWEurope project, several pilot-scale processes were tested by industrial and research partners to validate them in industrial settings. At the University of Liège, the PULSE (Phosphorus University of Liège Sludge Extraction) process was developed. It consists of sludge drying, which is essential for good process performance, leaching with hydrochloric acid, reactive extraction to remove unwanted metals such as iron and heavy metals, and fractional precipitation. Since sewage sludge changes properties during storage, the mobile pilot plant was operated at three different locations with fresh sewage sludge from wastewater treatment. To adapt the operating parameters of PULSE to the specifics of the respective sludges, they were optimized with the aid of simulations, based on cascaded option trees. A key point is the thermodynamic description of the aqueous speciation equilibria, of the reactive equilibria during extraction and of those describing precipitation. In particular, the model allows considering different models for the non-ideality of electrolyte solutions up to concentrated systems. The simulation tool can also be used to fit unknown parameters such as the equilibrium constants of reactive extraction. It was shown that the model is able to describe well all equilibria at the different process steps in the system. On the other hand, the optimal operating parameters could be confirmed experimentally. Finally, it was shown that the process can be operated well at pilot scale. The product obtained after precipitation was tested by the project partners and showed good performance as a fertilizer component in pot trials and could be easily incorporated into the granulation of a commercial fertilizer formulation.},

This study used fertilizer index (FI) and clean index (CI) as a tool for categorizing sludge utilization into different classes (A, B, C and limited use classes LU-1, LU-2, LU-3) by their fertilizing potential, toxicity level, pathogen presence, and vector attraction reduction criteria. The findings revealed that total P (as P2O5), total N, and K (as K2O) in the sludge samples ranged from 0.9 to 5.7\%, 1.2 to 3.8\%, and 0.1 to 1.5\%, respectively. Moreover, all sludges belong to Class C and lower category due to the presence of toxic metals and pathogens. The helminth eggs were found in the range of 25–1450 Numbers/4gTS in sludge samples. The highest number of helminth eggs of 1450/4 g of TS was found in the fecal sludge. The specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) values in the sludge samples varied from 0.3 to 4.9, with a median value of 1.3 and an RSD of 86\% is way too high. It indicates that the sludge samples need further treatment to be less attractive as a food source for vectors and rodents. However, sludge samples have fertilizing potential and FI values ranges from 4.1 to 4.9, and CI value ranges from 2.5 to 5.0. It indicates that compost is best in quality and has high-fertilizer potential and low heavy-metal content, which is suitable for high-value crops such as organic farming. Further sludge treatment using typical composting, aerobic or anaerobic digestion, and solar or thermal drying could bring the sludges into the Class A and B categories. Graphical abstract},

	abstract = {Biochar’s agricultural and environmental benefits have been widely demonstrated; however, it may cause environmental contamination if it contains large amounts of pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals (HMs). Therefore, this study aimed to assess the contents of PAHs and HM in a range of biochars generated from different sources and pyrolysis temperatures. A range of feedstock was converted to biochar, including sewage sludge (SS), olive mill pomace (OP), feather meal (FM), soft offal meal (CSM), chicken manure (CM), and date palm residues (DPR). Each feedstock was then pyrolyzed at three temperatures of 300, 500, or 700 °C, thereby producing a total of 18 types of biochar. These biochar products were analyzed for 16 PAHs and eight metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb). Benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and benzo(a)pyrene were significantly greater in the biochar produced at 700 °C than in that produced at 300 °C, especially for CM. The concentrations of dibenz(a,h)anthracene were significantly lower at 700 °C but greater at 500 °C and 300 °C in DPR. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 700 °C significantly increased the concentrations of metals, including Cr in SS and OP; Mn in CM; and Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn in SS. However, the concentration of Cd was significantly lower in the SS when biochar was produced at 700 °C than at 500 or 300 °C. The type of feedstock used and the pyrolysis temperature are key factors influencing the contents of PAHs and HMs in biochar, both of which need to be considered during the production and use of biochar. Further investigations are recommended to establish the relationships between pyrolysis temperature and types of feedstock and the formation of PAH or the concentrations of metals. Monitoring the concentrations of PAHs and HMs before applying biochar to soil is also recommended.},

Removal and recovery of phosphorus (P) from waste streams at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is one of the promising solutions. This paper reviews strategies for P recovery from waste streams in WWTPs are reviewed, and the main P recovery processes were broken down into three parts: enrichment, extraction, and crystallization. On this basis, the present P recovery technology was summarized and compared. The choice of P recovery technology depends on the process of sewage treatment and sludge treatment. Most P recovery processes can meet the financial requirements since the recent surge in phosphate rock prices. The safety requirements of P recovery products add a high cost to toxic substance removal, so it is necessary to control the discharge of toxic substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants from the source.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge (SS) is a reclaimable phosphorus (P) source for fertilizer production, but it has a high toxic trace element (TE) concentration. Using alkaline leaching of SS, P can be extracted without simultaneous extraction of TEs. However, low P recovery efficiency during alkaline leaching is a major challenge. This study explored alkaline leaching of P from alum sludge (AS)-amended dry SS, with or without acidic pretreatment. The amendment with AS was intended to promote apatite to non-apatite inorganic phosphorus conversion for a higher alkaline P recovery. The highest orthophosphate (ortho-P) alkaline recovery was 74 \% for the acid-pretreated SS + AS mix. Amending SS with AS averted the loss of ortho-P during acidic pretreatment by 59 \% compared to the reference case (unamended SS). Standards Measurements and Testing (SMT) analysis revealed apatite to non-apatite inorganic phosphorus conversion during acidic pretreatment, especially in the amended SS. This conversion was due to the dissolution of Ca-P and adsorption of dissolved ortho-P on Al(OH)3 during acidic pretreatment. Visual MINTEQ modelling, solid-state NMR (31P, 27Al and 31P-1H CP-HETCOR) and Al 2p XPS data indicated a high abundance of Al(OH)3(s), which enhanced the ortho-P adsorption. There was no formation of AlPO4, possibly because the acid-sludge mixture reached the metastable equilibrium and not the true equilibrium during acidic pretreatment. 31P liquid NMR, SEM, FTIR and XRD provided additional insight into the effects of acidic pretreatment on sludges. Overall, Ca-P to Al-P conversion enhanced alkaline ortho-P recovery by about 12 \% compared to the reference case (unamended + non-pretreated). This study demonstrated that P leaching efficiency from SS can be improved (with appropriate process modifications) irrespective of the intrinsic property of SS, thus making alkaline P recovery applicable in many regions globally. Additionally, the chemical co-treatment of SS + AS proposed is a prospective dual waste management strategy.},

Furthermore, a liquid poly-aluminum chloride (PAC)-based coagulant could also be synthesized with Al3+ removed from the ash and the brine, which behaved almost the same in the coagulation performance as a commercial coagulant on both phosphate and turbidity removals. Both P-recovery from the ash and coagulant production associated with the brine would enlarge the markets of both ‘blue’ phosphate and ‘green’ coagulants.},

Fortunately, phosphorus (P) in sludge can potentially be recovered via thermal treatment, and P forms are crucial to the quality of the recovered products. This review provides an overview related to the transformation of P and its regulation strategies in the different thermal treatment processes, highlighting the current knowledge regarding the influence factors and mechanisms of transformation. First, the current researches with P recovery by thermal treatments (i.e., incineration, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal carbonization) were illustrated and critically discussed, which indicates that the selection of appropriate method significantly affects the recovery effects, such as the proportion of Apatite Phosphorus (AP) or Ca-P (P combing with Ca). Furthermore, the effects of various factors (e.g., treatment techniques, temperature, additives, the composition of sludge, pH and metals ions) on the transformation or regulation of P forms were critically discussed, suggesting that temperature and Ca/Cl-based additives are the two crucial factors, which have the considerable effects on the emergence of Ca-P. Especially the Ca-based additives, which have the highest combining ability with P and the uppermost impact on hydroxyapatite formation. In addition, an overall comparison of incineration, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal carbonization technologies in practical applications is provided, focusing on the recovery efficiency, advantages, and disadvantages, demonstrating that HTC will be more predominant for P recovery from sludge in the future. Finally, challenges and potential development directions regarding the transformation mechanisms of P forms and regulate strategies are identified. This review will become the foundation for future research devoted to improving the quality of the recovered products.},

Here, we evaluated the environmental sustainability opportunity and socio-economic costs of recovering P from sewage sludge by replacing the current-day treatments (CT; sludge treatment and landfill) and P chemical fertilizer application (CF) in China using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing methods. Three potential P recovery scenarios (PR1‒PR3: struvite, vivianite, and treated sludge) and corresponding current-day scenarios (CT1‒CT3 and CF) were considered. Results indicated that PR1 and PR2 have smaller environmental impacts than the current-day scenarios, whereas PR3 has larger impacts in most categories. PR3 has the lowest net costs (sum of internal costs and benefits, 39.1–54.7 CNY per kg P), whereas PR2 has the lowest external costs (366.8 CNY per kg P). Societal costs for production and land use of 1 kg P by P recovery from sewage sludge (e.g., ∼527 CNY for PR1) are much higher than those of P chemical fertilizers (∼20 CNY for CF). However, considering the costs in the current-day treatments (e.g., ∼524 CNY for CT1), societal costs of P recovery scenarios are close to or slightly lower than those of current-day scenarios. Among the three P recovery scenarios, we found that recovering struvite as P fertilizer has the highest societal feasibility. This study will provide valuable information for improved sewage sludge management and will help promote the sustainable supply of P in China.},

	abstract = {Rapid industrialization, improved standards of living, growing economies and ever-increasing population has led to the unprecedented exploitation of the finite and non-renewable resources of minerals in past years. It was observed that out of 100 BMT of raw materials processed annually only 10\% is recycled back. This has resulted in a strenuous burden on natural or primary resources of minerals (such as ores) having limited availability. Moreover, severe environmental concerns have been raised by the huge piles of waste generated at landfill sites. To resolve these issues, ‘Urban Mining’ from waste or secondary resources in a Circular Economy’ concept is the only sustainable solution. The objective of this review is to critically examine the availability, elemental composition, and the market potential of the selected secondary resources such as lignocellulosic/algal biomass, desalination water, sewage sludge, phosphogypsum, and e-waste for minerals sequestration. This review showed that, secondary resources have potential to partially replace the minerals required in different sectors such as macro and microelements in agriculture, rare earth elements (REEs) in electrical and electronics industry, metals in manufacturing sector and precious elements such as gold and platinum in ornamental industry. Further, inputs from the selected life cycle analysis (LCA) \& techno economic analysis (TEA) were discussed which showed that although, urban mining has a potential to reduce the greenhouse gaseous (GHG) emissions in a sustainable manner however, process improvements through innovative, novel and cost-effective pathways are essentially required for its large-scale deployment at industrial scale in future.},

	abstract = {Cycling of nutrients, such as phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), is essential for all life: Nutrients are crucial for securing societies’ food systems and valuable raw materials for industrial processes. Recycling nutrients from various side and waste streams instead of virgin nutrients has attracted considerable interest in the society, particularly as geopolitical and epidemic issues have caused many nations to reconsider how they ensure flows of critical resources by increasing the Circular Economy (CE) principles. This study examines what drivers and barriers catalyze nutrient circulation in national settings, requiring diverse actors to support intentional nutrient recycling. By taking multidisciplinary and ecosystem approaches, we examine diverse sociotechnical drivers and barriers and the actor ecosystem involved. We conduct an extensive qualitative case study on nutrient circulation (P and N) in a Finnish context, analyzing over 150 documents and interviewing over 20 diverse actors (from diverse companies through ministries to farmers) involved in nutrient recycling, from biowaste through agricultural biomasses and sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Our study 1) generates an ecosystem actor map uncovering diverse actors enabling nutrient recycling in society; and 2) exposes technological, business, organizational, regulatory, linguistic, visual, and psychological drivers and barriers shaping nutrient circulation. It explains the sociotechnical preconditions for different actor/stakeholder groups to adopt and advocate circular economy (CE) principles for nutrient recycling, which are generalizable to other critical resources. The study contributes to CE research and advises practitioners by providing a comprehensive catalyst toolbox to advance nutrient circulation and facilitate its acceptability and diffusion.},

	abstract = {Biomass can be used to generate heat, power, or biofuels in thermal conversion processes such as combustion, gasification and pyrolysis. However, some types of biomass contain high levels of phosphorus, which can be released to the gas phase and cause operational or environmental problems. The mechanism(s) responsible for phosphorus release has not been convincingly established. Understanding the high-temperature phosphorus chemistry is also important in order to enable efficient recovery of phosphorus in residues from thermal conversion of biomass. In this work, the release of phosphorus from wheat bran char and sunflower seed char in different gas environments (100 \% N2, 1–20 \% O2, and 10 \% CO2) and temperatures (900–1100 °C) was studied. The chars were converted in a horizontal tube reactor and characterized using ICP-OES, XRD, SEM-EDS, and 31P NMR. The release of ash-forming elements was determined using ICP-OES analysis of the char and sample residues, whereas the release of carbon was determined using CO and CO2 gas analysis. In both chars, phosphorus was present primarily together with potassium and magnesium, mainly as pyrophosphates in the wheat bran char, and largely as orthophosphates in the sunflower seed char. For wheat bran char, the release of phosphorus increased from 27 \% at 900 °C to 71 \% at 1100 °C in N2, whereas the release was at least 20 \% lower in the oxidizing atmospheres (1–20 \% O2, or 10 \% CO2). The sunflower seed char reached a maximum release of 55 \% at 1100 °C in N2. For wheat bran char, the molar ratio of released carbon/phosphorus was close to 2.5, which fits well with the theoretical value for carbothermic reduction of phosphates (P2O5(s, l) + 5C(s) → P2(g) + 5CO(g)). At 1100 °C, in N2, the release of phosphorus, potassium and sodium occurred mainly during the first 10 min. It was shown that KMgPO4, used as a model compound, could be reduced by carbon starting from 950 °C, but that some of the phosphorus remained in the condensed phase. The work provides a better understanding of phosphorus release and presents evidence showing that carbothermic reduction reactions can be an important phosphorus release mechanism for seed- and grain-based biomass char.},

Five phosphorus recovery methods using sewage sludge or sludge ash as feed material were compared based on their specific operational recovery cost by scaling the processes to unified size and operational conditions. The selected technologies were (1) wet leaching + struvite precipitation, (2) magnetic vivianite separation, (3) sludge melt gasification, (4) the thermochemical sodium sulfate process, and (5) white phosphorus recovery. The analyses were based on the literature values in addition to a plant-wide model used to estimate chemical consumption and phosphorus and metal-related sludge properties. The technologies were assessed by operational cost, end-product quality, recovery efficiency, and technology maturity. The choice of the recovery process is dependent on the precipitant used in the wastewater treatment processes. Technologies using sewage sludge ash, (4) and (5), had the highest recovery efficiency, technical maturity, and product quality, but they require mono-incineration. Technology (3) had better recovery efficiency than (1), but the end-product had much lower P content. Technology (2) had the lowest recovery efficiency among all the compared technologies, however, it produced an end-product with the second highest P content. The operational costs were calculated for energy and chemical costs for same scale and operational conditions. The specific recovery cost ranges from 6 to 38 €/kgPrecovered.},

	abstract = {The recovery of phosphorus (P) from sewage sludge through pyrolysis is one of the most promising alternatives to alleviate the shortage of P supply in the future. Adding calcium additives is beneficial to the conversion of available P and helps to improve the recovery and utilization efficiency of P in biochar. This study thoroughly examined the influence of CaCO3 on the speciation and slow-release behavior of P in sludge during pyrolysis at 500 and 700 °C. The addition of CaCO3 could enhance the conversion of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) into more accessible apatite phosphorus (AP). We observed that adding CaCO3 (2.5–20 \%) to raw sludge at 500 °C increased the proportion of AP in inorganic phosphorus (IP) from 65.2 to 97.3 \% but did not increase the concentration of AP, which remained between 31.03 and 31.64 mg/g. At 700 °C, introducing CaCO3 (2.5–20 \%) boosted the AP content from 35.08 to 41.38 mg/g and increased the proportion of AP in IP from 67.7 to 98.6 \%. Moreover, irrespective of the pyrolysis temperature being 500 °C or 700 °C, the final main form of P in biochar with CaCO3 was Ca5(PO4)3OH, according to experimental characterization results (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction) and thermochemical calculations. Additionally, the efficacy of citric acid (CA) in releasing biochar-bearing P was tested in a laboratory extraction experiment for 21 days. CaCO3-amended biochar showed a significantly slower total phosphorus (TP) release than the biochar without CaCO3 daily, and the amount of TP decreased with increasing amounts of added CaCO3. The finding of this study indicates that biochar generated by adding 10 \% CaCO3 has the highest AP concentration (41.38 mg/g) at 700 °C, and its TP-release efficiency in CA is 0.29–1.98 mg/g in 21 days, which shows remarkable potential as a soil fertilizer with slow P release.},

	abstract = {Recycling of phosphorus (P) from pyrolysis sewage sludge is a good methodology to deal with the deficit of P resources and safely dispose the sewage sludge. However, it is essential to determine the type of sludge in sewage treatment plants (STPs) along with the most appropriate pyrolysis temperature. These factors affect the form and bioavailability of recoverable P. Thus, four kinds of sludge in a typical STP were selected, and three pyrolysis temperatures including 300, 500, and 700 °C were set to find a suitable strategy for P recovery. The results indicated that with increasing pyrolysis temperature, more organic phosphorus (OP) was transformed into inorganic phosphorus (IP) and more non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) was converted to apatite phosphorus (AP, mainly Ca3(PO4)2, Ca(H2PO4)2, Mg3(PO4)2, Ca3Mg3(PO4)4, and Ca5(PO4)3OH). Compared to other sludges, dewatered cake sludge (CS) pyrolyzed at 700 °C had the highest AP content, about 1.1–3.6 times that in other pyrolysis products, and the highest Ca5(PO4)3OH content containing 35.8\% of total phosphorus (TP). The contents of P-2\% citric acid (CA) and neutral ammonium citrate (NAC) in CS obtained by pyrolysis at 500 °C reached 45.6 and 49.6 mg/g, respectively, which were 1.1–3.0 and 1.1–2.8 times that of P-CA and P-NAC in other sludges and their biochars, respectively. Moreover, the diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid extraction analysis indicated that the good stability of heavy metals in CS-derived biochar was better than that in the feedstock. Hence, to ensure the efficiency and safety of P, CS is used as raw material in STPs to recover P resources. CS-500 can be used as the direct P source of land owing to the highest concentration of bioavailable P (P-CA and P-NAC), while CS-700 can be used to represent a slow-release P fertilizer because it contains the highest concentration of AP.},

	abstract = {This study developed a novel dewatering process coupled with nutrient recovery to raise the resource value of anaerobically digested sludge. The hydration of multicharged anions was proposed to compete with the hydration of hydrophilic organic components (i.e., salting-out effects). Accordingly, phosphate was used as the salting-out agent to improve sludge dewaterability, and simultaneously, it balanced the molar ratio of NH4+-N and PO43–-P in the aqueous phase, which could facilitate the recovery of N/P as struvite from the liquid digestate. The addition of phosphate (70\% of its solubility) at the initial sludge pH of 5 could obtain the lowest centrifugally dewatering equilibrium height (h∞) of 0.036 cm and reduce the bound water fraction by 63.5\%. For the first time, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) in situ identified the phosphorus speciation and microdistribution in anaerobically digested sludge. Additionally, the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) analysis confirmed that the organics-phosphate interactions led to a dense water-repelling system of sludge flocs with an increasing rigidity, which mainly contributed to the improved centrifugal dewatering performance. All the above contributions are expected to suggest a promising way for simultaneously recovering N/P, improving dewaterability, and facilitating liquid digestate treatment of anaerobically digested sludge.},

Reconciling these interests in sustainable management is a challenge for researchers. This study focuses on how research on sewage sludge management practices has evolved and scrutinizes how this research is interlinked with concerns and societal issues such as contaminants, economic efficiency, and legislation. Based on published academic papers on sewage sludge management between 1971 and 2019, this study found four trends in research focused on sewage sludge management: a decreasing interest in disposal (landfilling and sea dumping), a dominant interest in land application, a growing interest in sewage sludge as product, and a stable interest in energy recovery. Research on disposal focuses on increasing sludge volumes, legislative changes, and economic challenges with an interest in waste co-treatment. Research on land application concerns nutrient use and contaminants, mainly heavy metals. Research on sewage sludge as a product focuses on the extraction of certain resources and less on use of sewage sludge specifically. Research on energy recovery of sewage sludge focuses on volume reduction rather than contaminants. Two-thirds of the papers are detailed studies aiming to improve single technologies and assessing single risks or benefits. As management of sewage sludge is multifaceted, the narrow focus resulting from detailed studies promotes some concerns while excluding others. Therefore, this study highlights potential gaps such as the combination of nutrient use and disposal and energy recovery and nutrient use.},

	abstract = {Recovering phosphorus from wastewater in more concentrated forms has potential to sustainably recirculate phosphorus from cities to agriculture. The environmental sustainability of wastewater-based phosphorus recovery processes or wastewater-derived phosphorus products can be evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA). Many LCA studies used a process perspective to account for the impacts of integrating phosphorus recovery processes at wastewater treatment plants, while some used a product perspective to assess the impacts of producing wastewaterderived phosphorus products. We demonstrated the application of an end-user perspective by assessing life cycle environmental impacts of substituting half of the conventional phosphorus rock-based fertilizers used in three crop production systems with wastewaterderived phosphorus products from six recovery pathways (RPs). The consequential LCA results show that the substitution reduces global warming potential, eutrophication potential, ecotoxicity potential, and acidification potential of the assessed crop production systems in most RPs and scenarios. The end-user perspective introduced in this study can (i) complement with the process perspective and the product perspective to give a more holistic picture of environmental impacts along the “circular economy value chains” of wastewater-based resource recovery, (ii) enable systemwide assessment of wide uptake of wastewater-derived products, and (iii) draw attention to understanding the long-term environmental impacts of using wastewater-derived products.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The global phosphorus (P) cycle has been dramatically altered by human activities through the use of mineral P fertilizers, often referred to anthropogenic P. The application of mineral P fertilizers on agricultural soils has driven the planet beyond its safe operating space but the extent to which the global P cycle relies on anthropogenic P has never been quantified. To fill this gap, we developed a model that simulates, at the country scale, the evolution of agricultural soil available P by distinguishing anthropogenic vs. natural P pools, and by accounting for farming practices, crop-livestock recycling loop, and agricultural trade, over the 1950-2017 period. At the global scale we found that the anthropogenic signature of soil available P was 45\% ± 8\% in 2017. The national anthropogenic signatures varied according to the cumulative mineral P fertilizer use as well as to the soil P availability in 1950. Despite having different historical trajectories, Western Europe, North America and Asia displayed similar reliance on anthropogenic P, close to 60\% in 2017. Conversely, African soil anthropogenic signature remained around 30\%. Trade did not modify the simulated signatures. Overall, our results unravel the strong reliance of our soil fertility and food production systems on anthropogenic P resources.},

In this study, sewage sludges with Fe content of 0.3, 3.5 and 9.2 wt\% were obtained and pyrolyzed at 300 and 500 °C. Properties of the sewage sludge biochar (SSB) were characterized to explore the effects of Fe-level and pyrolysis temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis showed retarded weight loss at medium temperature range for high Fe-level sludge. Hematite was formed at high Fe-level but the crystallization of other minerals was disrupted. The porous structure was affected by Fe-level depending on temperature. The contents of C, H and N decreased in Fe-dosed SSB, while the H/C and C/N ratios varied with Fe-level. With the rise of Fe-level, the yield and ash content increased but the cation exchange capacity decreased. Due to catalytic effect and surface covering, iron-oxides promoted the dissolved and unstable organic carbon. The availability of P was decreased heavily even at medium Fe-level, caused by the formation of Fe−P species and the entrapment effect of iron-oxides. The available Ca and Mg were lowered in Fe-dosed SSB but N and K were less affected. When high Fe-level sludge was pyrolyzed at 500 °C, a recalcitrant iron-oxides layer appeared and lowered nutrient availabilities. The findings are useful for evaluating the role of Fe in determining SSB properties. The level of Fe should be controlled when SSB is produced aiming at land use, carbon sequestration and other purposes.},

The goal of this study was to characterize and evaluate the life-cycle global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential, and economic costs and benefits of sidestream nutrient management and biosolid management strategies following digestion of sewage sludge augmented by HSOW. Five sidestream nutrient management strategies were analyzed using environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) for codigestion of municipal sewage sludge with and without HSOW.

Composting all biosolids dramatically reduced the GWP relative to the baseline biosolid option but had slightly higher eutrophication potential.

	abstract = {Japan relies on imports for almost the entire amount of phosphorus, which is indispensable for human life and industrial materials. Therefore it is required to recover phosphorus from dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge which are promising unutilized phosphorus resources. Aiming wholesale recovery of phosphorus from the slag and sludge, a fundamental study on condensation of phosphorus in solid phase through high temperature phase separation was carried out. The experiments at 1573 K on principal [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary model sample and Al2O3 and Fe2O3 added therein showed unsaturation with CaO and precipitation of solid 3CaO·P2O5 as the phosphorus-concentrated phase in all the sample. The contamination of the other components in 3CaO·P2O5 was low, especially less than 1 mass\% for Al2O3 added samples. The liquid phase was also formed with Al2O3 or Fe2O3 addition, and the liquidus composition in quaternary samples were consistent with those appeared in [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3] and [CaO–SiO2–Al2O3] ternary diagram. P2O5 content in the quaternary liquid phases were lower in Al2O3 added samples than those in Fe2O3 added samples. Such difference was discussed in terms of optical basicity and CaO activity for liquid phase. Due to the coexistence of solid SiO2 phase at Fe2O3 addition, the SiO2 content in liquid phase became lower compared to Al2O3 addition, and led to higher optical basicity, which would allow higher P2O5 capacity in liquid phase. These considerations strongly suggest that an effective control of composition would be key technology for the phosphorus recovery through condensation and separation of phosphorus concentrated phase.

1. Introduction

Phosphorus is an essential element for human body since it composes bone, tooth, and even for whole life as a constituent of gene. Phosphorus is one of the most important element of fertilizer, so it is required for the growing needs of agricultural production in response to the increase in world population, and further for the raising demands of field-crop production for biofuel. Phosphorus is also widely utilized in industry such as plating, semiconductor, food additives and so on.
With respect to Japanese situation, almost all of the phosphorus consumption depends on imports, since no phosphorus ore is produced domestically. In 2018, 219 thousand tons of phosphorus ore was imported,1) which corresponds to over 30 thousand tons of phosphorus, provided that the phosphorus content of phosphorus ore is 15 mass\%. On the other hand, there are concerns about global depletion of phosphorus ore with high quality. Therefore, stable and longitudinal supply of phosphorus would be an important issue in Japan.2)
Unutilized and promising domestic resources of phosphorus would be steelmaking slag (dephosphorization slag) and sewage sludge in view of those generation amount. In steelmaking process, phosphorus originally comes from iron ore and must be sufficiently removed as a typical impurity from molten iron into steelmaking slag. Since dephosphorization slag normally contains P2O5 less than 10 mass\% and is multi-component system, it is not easy to recover phosphorus from dephosphorization slag. Steelmaking slag is normally used for civil engineering such as road constructing stuff, which is not requested in terms of phosphorus containing material, however, the annual production of steelmaking slag in Japan is as huge as about 11 million tons,3) which leads to the amount of phosphorus more than 100 thousand tons in the slag.
Various studies aiming phosphorus recovery from dephosphorization slag have been carried out. Shiomi et al. proposed the phosphorus recovery process in which iron oxide and phosphorus oxide in the slag were reduced with cokes by carbothermic method to obtain Fe–P–C alloy and phosphorus was vaporized afterward by FeSi addition to the alloy.4) Takeuchi et al. investigated the process comprising of carbothermic reduction of BOF slag under coexistence of FeSi, iron recovery into FeSi alloy and concurrent phosphorus recovery of gaseous P2 in arc plasma melting.5) The influence of slag fluidity, basicity and the flow rate of purging gas on phosphorus vaporization was also considered in their study.
Nakase et al. reported the influence of FetO content in the slag on reduction/separation behaviour of iron and phosphorus from dephosphorization slag, and the promoting conditions of phosphorus vaporization under various FetO content.6) Since reduced phosphorus tends to permeate into concurrently reduced metallic iron in all the above methods, a separation of iron and phosphorus has been problem.
Phosphorus recovery from dephosphorization slag with wet method has been also investigated. Iwama et al. studied the selective extraction of phosphoric compound by nitric acid and the recovery of phosphate compound from the extract solution, controlling the slag composition (Fe2+/Fe3+). Taking consideration of mass treatment of dephosphorization slag, a large amount of waste water would be generated in wet process. Therefore, pyro-process might be preferable for phosphorus recovery from the slag.
Sewage sludge contains phosphorus originally from social life or farming, and generates constantly. The phosphorus content in sewage sludge (dry ash) is as high as 15 mass\%, and its generation is about 2.3 million tons annually in Japan.8) Therefore about 300 thousand tons of phosphorus is accumulated in sewage sludge. Although sewage sludge is partly utilized for fertilizer, it is mostly applied for construction or landfilling, not for phosphorus resource. One of the reason would be that sewage sludge easily melts to homogeneous liquid at elevated temperature and is not suitable for separation of phosphorus.
As mentioned above, steelmaking slag and sewage sludge would be promising phosphorus resources, but each composition is not suitable for individual mass treatment with pyro-process. Since the main components of both materials are similar, it would be helpful if phosphorus in the both is recovered concurrently by combining them. A typical composition of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge referred from the literatures9,10) are shown in Table 1. Both are multi-component system and consist of CaO and SiO2 as main components being almost half of the whole mass. Provided that a kind of artificial phosphate rock could be obtained as a domestic phosphorus resource through such combination, steelmaking slag might be expected as a potential ecological byproduct. So the course of the study has begun aiming wholesale recovery of phosphorus through mixing the slag and the sludge and heating said mixture to precipitate and separate phosphorus-concentrated solid phase.Table 1. Typical composition of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge (in mass\%).CaOSiO2P2O5FeOFe2O3Al2O3MgOMnOC/S*De-P Slag26.322.23.024.77.65.16.14.91.2Sewage Sludge15.330.822.20.916.514.10.10.5*)   (mass\%CaO)/(mass\%SiO2)
One can speculate that phase relationship at elevated temperature might be complex in a mixture of multi-component oxide such as slag and sludge. Therefore, [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] system is selected to be basic system, which comprises of CaO and SiO2 as the common major components and of P2O5 as a target component for recovery. Some phase diagrams regarding this system has been reported.11,12,13) However, most of them show only liquidus line and primary crystal, and phase relationship at the temperature region in which solid phase coexists is not given in detail. Saito et al.14) reported a part of the isothermal section of [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary system at 1573 K as in Fig. 1. The feature of this system attributes to solid solution which has continuous composition lying along the tie line between Ca2SiO4 (hereafter C2S) and Ca3P2O8 (hereafter C3P). In the compositional region with higher CaO content against the tie line, due to the high basicity (mass\%CaO/mass\%SiO2, hereafter C/S) and wide CaO saturation, numerous researches has been carried out in view of steel refining. On the other hand, with respect to the lower basicity region against the tie line in Fig. 1, the equilibria among CaSiO3 (hereafter CS) and C2S–C3P solid solution is partly given. Further evaluation was reported by the present authors about the C2S–C3P solid solution phase coexisting with CS in the corresponding phosphorus-containing system at 1573 K.15) Also a related study about the phosphorus-concentrated phase appeared in the slag with said lower bulk basicity, in contact with phosphorus-containing molten iron.16) However, no phase relationship for the compositional region with still lower CaO concentration is available.Fig. 1. Isothermal section of CaO–SiO2–P2O5 ternary phase diagram at 1573 K.
The compositions of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge in Table 1 are projected on the isothermal section in Fig. 1. The composition of these mixture lies on the line connecting these points and is located at the area with lower CaO concentration against C2S–C3P tie line. This connecting line crosses a triangular zone comprising of SiO2, CS and C3P apices. Such compositional zone would be expected to be unsaturated with CaO at 1573 K, but further information on the phase relation is unclear.
In this study, aiming to basically understand the phase relationship in the mixture of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge at elevated temperature, the phase equilibria at high phosphate concentration and without CaO saturation was investigated for [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary model slag at 1573 K. The influence of adding Al2O3 and Fe2O3 as fourth component on the phase relation was also investigated.

2. Experimental Aspects

2.1. Materials

Starting materials for the experiment were CaCO3, Ca2P2O7, SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 of reagent grade. Those were weighed and mixed at predetermined composition in advance.
At first, considering the compositions of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge in Table 1, the samples were prepared by selecting the principle three components of CaO, SiO2 and P2O5. The composition of [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary samples are listed in Table 2 and are plotted on [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary phase diagram in Fig. 2. These compositions correspond to the mixing ratio 1:1, 3:1 and 1:2 of the slag and the sludge, and lie in the triangular zone consisting of the apex of SiO2, CS, and C3P. The samples with the same C/S as L1-0 and different P2O5 content was also prepared to confirm consistence between equilibrium phases and phase diagram in that region.Table 2.

Sample compositions projected on CaO–SiO2–P2O5 ternary phase diagram at 1573 K.
The quaternary samples were prepared based on L1-0 with an addition of Al2O3 and Fe2O3 to evaluate the effect of these addition. The compositions are listed in Table 3. The ratio of CaO–P2O5–SiO2 are kept constant, and the fourth component was added by 5, 10 and 13 mass\% respectively.Table 3. Composition of quaternary samples (1) (in mass\%).CaOSiO2P2O5Al2O3Fe2O3L1-A534.941.918.25.0L1-A1033.139.717.310.0L1-A1332.538.316.113.1L1-F534.941.918.25.0L1-F1033.139.717.310.0L1-F1332.538.316.113.1
Furthermore, the influence of C/S was investigated varying the ratio of CaO to SiO2 based on L1-0 at constant Al2O3 and P2O5 concentration. The composition of the samples are listed in Table 4, and are projected with gray circles on the [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary phase diagram in Fig. 2.Table 4.

2.2. Experimental Procedure

The specimens were heated in a resistance furnace equipped with a mullite reaction tube (Nikkato co., HB, od50 × id42 × L1000 mm) and SiC heater (Siliconit co., A8-2) as shown in Fig. 3. Ar gas or purified air dehydrated with silica gel was introduced as an atmospheric gas to the reaction tube at 100 mL/min.Fig. 3. Schematic illustration of experimental setup.
1 g of specimen on a platinum plate was mounted on a refractory boat and was placed in uniform temperature zone of the reaction tube which was determined at the preliminary heating. The experimental temperature was kept at 1573 K during more than 50 hrs for the ternary samples and 2 hrs for the quaternary samples. After keeping for the predetermined duration, the specimen was pulled for quenching to the low temperature zone less than about 373 K at the end of the reaction tube. Then the specimen was embedded in curing resin, and was finally polished to be served for SEM-EDX analysis. The average value of quantitative spot analysis for more than 3 points was employed for identification of the composition of each phase.

In terms of the Gibbs phase rule for condensed system, thermodynamic degree of freedom is unity when three phases coexist in ternary system at constant temperature. This means the appearance of the same equilibrium phases independent on bulk composition. Since the same three mineral phases were observed for the samples with different bulk composition lying in the focused triangular zone, it is thermochemically valid so that the specimen attained equilibrium. Moreover, the coexistence of the three phases of CS, C3P and SiO2 would agree with the previous phase diagram, in which CS–C3P, CS–SiO2 and C3P–SiO2 pseudo-binary system are reported as eutectic systems11,17,18) and the present experimental temperature of 1573 K is lower than each solidus temperature.
The SiO2 content in C3P phase for the ternary specimens were not higher than 1.7 mass\%.

3.2. Phase Equilibria in Quaternary Samples

Figure 6 shows the SEM images of the specimens in which Fe2O3 or Al2O3 was added to the aforementioned ternary sample L1-0 (slag:sludge = 1:1).Fig. 6. SEM images of quaternary samples (1).
The composition of each mineral phase observed in Fe2O3 added samples with spot analysis are listed in Table 6, and are projected on the [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] phase diagram in Fig. 7. Solid C3P and SiO2 phases were identified in all the samples, while the solid CS phase were disappeared and the liquid phase were observed. Fe2O3 content in the liquid phase ranged in 17.5–19.6 mass\% and increased according to Fe2O3 content in the bulk sample. A contrast of C3P phase and the liquid phase were reversed among the sample with 5 mass\%Fe2O3 and those with 10 or 13 mass\%Fe2O3. The P2O5 content in the liquid phases were 6–8 mass\%. C3P phases contained about 2 mass\% of Fe2O3.Table 6.

The composition of each mineral phase observed in Al2O3 added samples with spot analysis are listed in Table 6, and are projected on CaO–SiO2–P2O5 phase diagram in Fig. 8. Solid C3P phases were identified in all the samples, and contained Al2O3 no more than 0.5 mass\%. This would be advantageous in view of phosphorus recovery through separation of phosphorus-concentrated solid phase with low impurities.Fig. 8. Composition of the observed phases in the quaternary samples containing Al2O3 projected on CaO–SiO2–P2O5 diagram (1).
Three phases were observed in the sample L1-A5 containing 5 mass\%Al2O3, which were solid SiO2 and C3P phases, and the liquid phase originally from CS phase. Al2O3 was concentrated in the liquid phase and its content was 8.9 mass\%. In the sample L1-A10 containing 10 mass\%Al2O3, SiO2 phase was disappeared and C3P phase and the liquid phase remained. Al2O3 content in the liquid phase was 14.3 mass\%. In the sample L1-A13 containing 13 mass\%Al2O3, C3P phase and the liquid phase with Al2O3 content of 17.7 mass\% were also observed. The P2O5 content in the liquid phases were less than 6 mass\% and were lower than those of Fe2O3 added sample.
For Al2O3 added samples, phosphorus-concentrated phase (C3P) and the other liquid phase were separated. Such phase relation is preferable for the concentration and separation of phosphorus in the sample. Therefore, further investigation into the influence of composition on phase relation was done employing the sample with different ratio of CaO and SiO2 content (basicity) and under constant P2O5 and Al2O3 content in the sample.
Figure 9 show SEM images of the sample with different basicity. The composition of each mineral phase observed in these samples with spot analysis are listed in Table 7, and are projected on [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] phase diagram in Fig. 10. Solid C3P, solid SiO2, and the liquid phase were identified in the sample A10-0.6 with the basicity of 0.6. For the samples with higher basicity, solid C3P and the liquid phase were observed.Fig. 9.

Al2O3 content in the liquid phase were almost same at around 14 mass\% due to the constant Al2O3 content of 10 mass in the bulk sample, except for the sample A10-0.6 with SiO2 saturation. P2O5 content in the liquid phase were varied according to the bulk basicity. Al2O3 content in solid C3P phases were no more than 1 mass\%.
Based on the above results, solid C3P phase would be expected to be separated as phosphorus-concentrated phase for the model slag in the present research supposing the mixture of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge.
The mass ratio of CaO and P2O5 in the C3P phases obtained for the present ternary and quaternary samples were lower than that of stoichiochemical compound of 54.2:45.8, in spite of some contamination of another components. Referring to CaO–P2O5 binary phase diagram, C3P forms α’-C3P which has homogeneity range extending to higher P2O5 content than stoichiochemical composition, with the maximum extension at around 1573 K.19) The aforementioned lower P2O5 content in the solid C3P phases would reflect such situation. The composition and contamination of gangue component in C3P are investigated by the present authors and would be reported in the future.


4. Discussion

4.1. Interpretation of Liquidus Composition through Phase Diagram

With the addition of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 to the sample L1-0 comprising of [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary components, the solid CS phase disappeared and the liquid phase was formed. The P2O5 content of the liquid phases were around several mass\% and were lower than the Fe2O3 or Al2O3 contents. Therefore, the liquidus compositions are projected on the isothermal section of [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3]20) and [CaO–SiO2–Al2O3]21) ternary diagram at 1573 k in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively.Fig. 11. Composition of the observed phases in the quaternary samples containing Fe2O3 projected on CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3 diagram.Fig. 12. Composition of the observed phases in the quaternary samples containing Al2O3 projected on CaO–SiO2–Al2O3 diagram.
In Fig. 11, the liquidus compositions of [CaO–SiO2–P2O5–Fe2O3] quaternary samples lie in two phase region under CS saturation of [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3] diagram. This would be reasonable considering that the liquid phase of the quaternary sample was formed by the addition of Fe2O3 into the ternary sample and the resulting dissolution of CS phase. Since the liquid phase contains several mass\% of P2O5, one can understand to find that it has lower Fe2O3 content than the ternary liquidus line.
In Fig. 12, the liquidus compositions of [CaO–SiO2–P2O5–Al2O3] quaternary samples, including various Al2O3 content and basicity, are projected on [CaO–SiO2–Al2O3] diagram. Those liquidus compositions almost lie in two phase region under CS saturation, or in homogeneous liquid region equilibrated with CS. This would be due to the dissolution of CS phase by the addition of Al2O3 into the ternary sample. With the addition of Al2O3 into the ternary sample L1-0, solid SiO2 dissolved for the sample L1-A10 and L1-A13. This would lead to the increase of SiO2 content in the liquid phases of these samples, and those compositions result in relatively higher SiO2 content compared to those of corresponding Fe2O3 added samples (L1-F10 and L1-F13) with SiO2 saturation.
The relationship between basicity of bulk sample and of liquid phase is given in Fig. 13. Among the samples with various bulk basicity, the higher the bulk basicity, the higher the basicity of the liquid phases are. Since solid C3P phase was formed in each sample, the basicity of the liquid phases are relatively lower than the bulk basicity. Comparing the liquidus basicity of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 added samples at the same bulk basicity, Fe2O3 added samples are higher due to the separation of solid SiO2 phase as mentioned above.Fig. 13. Relationship between Bulk C/S and Liquidus C/S in the quaternary samples.

4.2. P2O5 Content in Liquid Phase

For all the model quaternary samples of the mixture of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge in this study, C3P as a phosphorus-concentrated phase and liquid phase with low P2O5 content were formed. Less P2O5 in the liquid phase is preferable in view of efficient phosphorus recovery. Therefore, a condition for lower P2O5 content in the liquid phase is considered based on phase relationship.
In general, a stability of components in multicomponent oxide system is considered in terms of basic or acidic character of the components. Here a theoretical optical basicity for the liquidus composition of the samples employed in this study is referred and related to the P2O5 content.
Theoretical optical basicity Λth was calculated based on the method by Nakamura et al.,22) using optical basicity, mole fraction and oxygen ion fraction of each oxide.

where ni is a number of oxygen ion in oxide i, Xi is a mole fraction of oxide i, and Λi is an optical basicity of oxide i.
In Fig. 14, the liquidus Λth is given against the liquidus basicity (C/S). The liquidus Λth is calculated with [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3] and [CaO–SiO2–Al2O3] ternary components, excluding P2O5. The higher the liquidus basicity is, the higher the Λth becomes. This would be characteristic for the sample in this study, since the bulk content of Fe2O3 or Al2O3 are not varied much and the liquidus contents of those component are not so largely different.Fig. 14. Relationship between Liquidus C/S and optical basicity in the quaternary samples.
The relationship between the Λth and P2O5 content in the liquid phase is given in Fig. 15, showing good positive relation. P2O5, being an acidic oxide, would be stabilized in liquid phase with higher Λth and would hold higher concentration. It should be mentioned, here at this point, that P2O5 content in liquid phase is different between Fe2O3 containing samples and Al2O3 containing samples with the same bulk basicity. This would be due to the difference in formation of solid SiO2 phase for both samples as referred in the previous section. With respect to the Al2O3 containing samples (white triangles in the figure), solid SiO2 phase was not formed except for the case at mass\%Al2O3 = 5 and became rich in SiO2 in the liquid phase. On the other hand, all the Fe2O3 containing samples (gray rhombuses in the figure) formed solid SiO2 phase and became relatively poor in SiO2 in the liquid phase. Therefore, the liquidus Λth gets lower and the P2O5 content in the liquid phase could be lower for the Al2O3 containing samples at the same bulk basicity.Fig. 15. Relationship between optical basicity and mass\%P2O5 in liquid phase in the quaternary samples.
Phosphorus distribution ratio between solid phase and liquid phase is evaluated as an index for distribution of P2O5 in the specimen. This index is given by the ratio of P2O5 content of solid C3P phase as a phosphorus-concentrated phase and the liquid phase. The phosphorus distribution ratio LP is plotted against the liquidus Λth in Fig. 16. Despite of some scattering, the LP becomes lower with the increase in Λth. Seemingly such tendency is contrary to the comprehension about phosphorus distribution between slag/metal in ferrous refining23) and that between solid/liquid in dephosphorization slag.24) In the samples employed in this study, phosphorus-containing solid phase was formed as a stoichiochemical compound C3P. Under such situation, the value of numerator in the distribution ratio LP, which corresponds to the solid phase, is not largely varied, while the value of denominator in the LP corresponds to the liquid phase and would be varied depending on the slag composition. Therefore, the key for excluding phosphorus out of the liquid phase in the present slag system may come up how to decrease the liquidus Λth.Fig. 16. Relationship between optical basicity and phosphorus distribution ratio in slag.
However, if the bulk basicity is lowered to decrease the liquidus Λth, the LP could not increase as in the case for the sample with basicity of 0.6, in which solid SiO2 phase is formed. Furthermore, solid SiO2 might contaminate into phosphorus-concentrated solid as an impurity in separating operation. So it is important to consider an appropriate condition for the various composition.
The P2O5 content in the liquid phase is considered from thermochemical viewpoint. P2O5, being an acidic oxide, would become more unstable and get poorer at lower CaO activity in the liquid phase. Since the activities of the components in the present quaternary samples have not been reported, the activities of the ternary system are referred and compared.
With respect to the Fe2O3 containing samples, the liquidus composition lie in the region with CS saturation when projected on the isothermal section of [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3] diagram as shown in Fig. 11. In this region, the activities are constant on the tie line between CS and the liquidus line, and change with the composition along the liquidus line. The liquidus point 1f in Fig. 11 gives the lowest CaO activity in this zone, and is also an apex of the neighboring zone of 3 phase coexistence with SiO2 and CS. The CaO activity at this compositional point is provided after Eq. (2) and is evaluated through Eq. (3) based on reevaluation of the data compiled by Kubaschewski.25,26)

If one could consider the CaO activity through the above equations based on [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3] system at the experimental temperature of 1573 K, it would be estimated as log aCaO = −2.92{\textasciitilde}−2.07.
For the Al2O3 containing samples, the liquidus compositions lie widely in the region with CS saturation when projected on the isothermal section of [CaO–SiO2–Al2O3] diagram as shown in Fig. 12. In these cases, the phase relation is complex since CS coexists with CaO·Al2O3·2SiO2 (anorthite) or 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2 (gehlenite). Therefore, the CaO activities are evaluated on the endpoints of related liquidus line 1a–4a in the figure.
The point 1a is also an apex of the neighboring zone of 3 phase coexistence with SiO2 and CS as above. The CaO activity is provided under Eq. (2) and is derived as log aCaO = −2.92.
For the point 2a–4a, equilibrium with anorthite or gehlenite should be considered. The Gibbs energy of formation is given in the data compilation.27)

But the CaO activity cannot be provided by the above equations. Therefore the CaO activities for said endpoints are evaluated using thermodynamic software FactSage7.328) for convenience. The calculated activities are log aCaO = −4.09 at point 1a, log aCaO = −3.60 at point 2a, log aCaO = −3.37 at point 3a and log aCaO = −3.12 at point 4a respectively. According to the Eq. (3), log aCaO = −2.92 for point 1a is the same as for point 1f and is different from the above value by one order. Further evaluation on the activity at point 2f in [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3] system gives log aCaO = −3.08, which is also different from the value after the Eq. (5) by one order. So only semi-quantitative comparison could be made here.
The CaO activities calculated above are shown against the basicity of corresponding composition in Fig. 17. The CaO activity smoothly increases along with the increase in the basicity (CaO content) from point 1a to 4a in the phase diagram. The range of liquidus basicity for L1-F5–F13 as Fe2O3 containing samples and for L1-A5–A13 as Al2O3 containing samples, which have the same bulk basicity, are shown by arrows in the figure. The liquidus basicity for Fe2O3 containing samples is 0.74–0.81, while is as low as 0.37–0.55 for Al2O3 containing samples. Therefore, the CaO activity of liquid phase would be relatively lower for Al2O3 containing samples in view of the trend in Fig. 17. This would lead to a higher P2O5 activity. Although the activity coefficient of P2O5 is unknown in the present system, this would not inconsistent with the lower P2O5 content in liquid phase for Al2O3 containing samples.Fig. 17. Calculated CaO activity under various slag basicity.
The Fe2O3 containing samples bring log aCaO = −4.09{\textasciitilde}−3.08 between point 1f-2f under the calculation with FactSage, whereas the Al2O3 containing samples bring log aCaO = −4.09{\textasciitilde}−3.60 between point 1a-2a. This would result from the phase relationship, that the liquid phase equilibrated with solid CS at 1573 K in [CaO–SiO2–Al2O3] system does not coexist with solid C3S2 with higher CaO activity, and that point 2a is located in relatively lower CaO content than point 2f. It is important to investigate and understand the phase relation in detail for the control of P2O5 distribution in slag.


5. Conclusions

(1) Aiming wholesale recovery of phosphorus from the mixture of dephosphorization slag and sewage sludge, phase equilibria of model samples at elevated temperature was investigated based on [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary system and Al2O3 and Fe2O3 addition thereto.
(2) The model samples prepared from chemical reagents and heated to 1573 K, in which the mixing ratio of the ternary composition corresponding to dephosphorization slag (51.1 mass\%CaO-43.1 mass\%SiO2-5.8 mass\%P2O5) and to that corresponding to sewage sludge (22.4 mass\%CaO-45.1 mass\%SiO2-32.5 mass\%P2O5) are 1:1, 3:1 and 1:2. With these samples, the coexistence of solid SiO2, CaO·SiO2 and 3CaO·P2O5 is confirmed in the compositional region without CaO saturation in the isothermal section of [CaO–SiO2–P2O5] ternary system at 1573 K.
(3) In the quaternary samples with the addition of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 to the aforementioned mixing ratio of 1:1, though the CaO·SiO2 phase was disappeared and the liquid phase was formed, the solid 3CaO·P2O5 as the phosphorus-concentrated phase remained in all of the samples. The liquidus composition in the quaternary samples were similar to those appeared in [CaO–SiO2–Fe2O3] and [CaO–SiO2–Al2O3] ternary diagram.
(4) P2O5 content in the quaternary liquid phases were lower in Al2O3 added samples. Such difference was interpreted in terms of lower optical basicity and lower CaO activity of the liquid phase for Al2O3 added samples compared to the Fe2O3 added samples.

	abstract = {Non-renewable phosphorus (P) largely converges into waste activated sludge (WAS) during sewage treatment, thus P reclamation from WAS is essential for sustainable utilization of P resource. Hydrothermal (HT) process is a promising and widely used sanitation technique for improving WAS recycling efficiency, whilst the transformation and bioavailability of dissolved organic P (DOP) in WAS following HT treatment are unclear. Therefore, this work unveiled the transformation pathway of DOP during HT process using Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry coupled with molecular reaction network analysis, and its bioavailability was determined by enzymatic hydrolysis. In summary, DOP underwent a two-stage transformation following HT treatment. In stage I (50 °C–120 °C), adenosine triphosphate and ribonucleic acid were initially solubilized at 50 °C, followed by P-diesters (ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acid) and P-monoesters (mononucleotides, phospholipids) at 70 °C. Meanwhile, the release of P-monoesters is highly parallel to the solubilization of protein (R2 = 0.81–0.96, p {\textless} 0.05). Then, these DOP compounds were decomposed into DOP hydrolysates with high bioavailability including phosphoenolpyruvic acid, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and 1-phosphono butanedioate, etc. DOP enzymatic hydrolysis test also revealed a maximum bioactive concentration of 41.69 mg L−1 at 120 °C. During stage II (120 °C–200 °C), the DOP hydrolysates reacted with nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds (e.g., pyrimidine, pyridine, and pyrazine) generated in Maillard reactions, and caused formation of CNON compounds with low bioavailability (8.23 mg L−1 at 200 °C). In addition, reduction, decarbonization, decarboxylation, and nitration played significant roles in DOP transformation. And toxic phosphonates were dissolved into aqueous phase above 160 °C and progressively increased with temperature. This study provided a theoretic basis for sludge P recovery and efficient utilization based on HT treatment.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an indispensable nutrient for agriculture. Recovery and recycling of phosphorus from waste streams is necessary to ensure a circular P economy and reduce dependence on disproportionately distributed mineral P resources. In this study, a new process called ‘PULSE’ is presented for the recovery of P from sewage sludge, which can handle high metal contents. The process involves drying of sludge prior to acidic leaching to overcome the challenge of solid-liquid separation at low pH and to reduce the overall material flows. Another key point of the process is the removal of metals using reactive extraction to obtain a high-quality product with good plant availability. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate and select the best process options. A chemical equilibrium tool was developed to simulate the unit operations of the process for optimization. Dissolution of P from sludge depends on leaching pH and the fraction of inorganic P in the sludge. The maximum P leaching efficiency for the sludge used in the study was between 65 and 70\%. Under the tested conditions, Fe, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn were successfully removed from the sludge leach liquor by reactive extraction. The recovered product has a nutrient mass fraction of about 51\% that includes Ca, PO43-, Mg, and K. Pot trials confirmed that the agronomical efficiency of the product is comparable to that of triple superphosphate.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge represents a renewable source of organic carbon and nutrients such as nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) that can be valorised through the recovery of energy carriers (e.g. biofuels) and fertilizers (N, K, and P precipitates). This review analyses{\textgreater}60 recent studies that have investigated P recovery potential from sewage sludge by hydrothermal processes. The effect of process parameters such as temperature, residence time, pressure, solid-to-liquid ratio, and addition of additives on P conversion pathways has been investigated by a critical discussion of the results published in the literature. Results show that temperature is the most influential parameter for P speciation and repartition: the increase in temperature appears to promote the increase in solid P recovery yield, the mineralization of organic P, and the conversion of non-apatitic P into apatitic P. The increase in reaction time has similar effects as temperature, but to a lesser extent. Solid P recovery yield and apatitic P fraction can be enhanced by increasing the medium alkalinity and by adding Ca-containing reactants. Non-apatitic P fraction can be increased by lower medium alkalinity, and by the addition of Fe- and Al-containing reactants. The results of this review provide to researchers and practitioners in the field of sewage sludge management key elements for the best operation of hydrothermal reactors to improve the recovery of P and biofuels. Finally, some new research perspectives and technical challenges are proposed to improve the knowledge and the scaling up of the technology.},

A chemical conditioning procedure (65\% HNO3) was used to prepare the leachate solution for fertilization. The feasibility of producing an amino acid-based fertilizer using shrimp shells and inorganic acids (96\% H2SO4 and 85\% H3PO4) was also demonstrated. Microbiological analysis confirmed the safety of the formulations, and chelation of micronutrients with available amino acids was proven (up to 100\% chelating degree). The bioavailability of all nutrients was confirmed through extraction tests (extraction in neutral ammonium citrate). Germination tests showed similar fresh plant masses to those with commercial preparations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed technology. This approach aligns with circular economy principles and sustainable development and contributes to mitigating the impacts of climate change.},

	abstract = {Transformation of phosphorus (P) species during pyrolytic production of biochar from P-rich biowastes with a subsequent soil amendment is important to P reclamation. Aiming at increasing the content of plant-available P and restraining the formation of easily mobile P in pyrolysis product, this study used exogenous calcium ions (20 wt\% CaCl2) addition prior to pyrolysis to regulate the pyrolytic transformation of P chemical fractions from sewage sludge and bone dreg. Results showed that active Ca catalyzed the decomposition of organic P to transform into inorganic orthophosphate. Based on Hedley’s sequential extraction method, this study found that addition of Ca ions remarkably reduced the content of soluble P, exchange P, Fe/Al bound P, and occluded P in biochar, while increased Ca bound P from 78 to 85\% to 85–96\%. Liquid 31P NMR indicated that exogenous Ca induced the crack of the P-O-P bond in pyrophosphate to become orthophosphates. It also explained why new orthophosphates including chlorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3Cl) and calcium hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) appeared in the Ca-composite biochar compared to pristine biochar. Combined with rapid P-release test in paddy soil (pH 6.27) and 30-days rice seedling growth test under flooded condition (10 wt\% biochar addition ratio), it was confirmed that compared to pristine biochar, Ca-composite biochar released more P in paddy soil, but also promoted more P to be taken in by rice root and stalk. These results suggested that pretreating biowaste with Ca ion was a friendly approach to enhance P reclamation during biochar formation, making it a promising P fertilizer.},

	abstract = {A sustainable strategy for P recovery from sewage sludge via alkali-activated pyrolysis, water leaching and crystallization was proposed, and a high value-added product of vivianite was recovered. Effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on P transformation during sludge pyrolysis were investigated. 50 wt\% dose of KHCO3 was determined as the alkali-activated pyrolysis condition. The content of water-soluble P (referred to as Water-P) in biochar derived from raw sludge (referred to as RS) and ferric sludge (Fenton's reagent conditioned sludge, referred to as FS) by KHCO3-activated pyrolysis at different temperatures was compared. The Fe element in the Fenton's reagent enhanced the content of Fe-bound P in the dewatered sludge, which was readily transformed into potassium phosphate during KHCO3-activated pyrolysis, thus increasing the Water-P content in the biochar derived from FS. The proportions of Water-P to total P in the biochar samples obtained by KHCO3-activated pyrolysis of RS and FS at 600 °C were 72.5\% and 96.2\%, respectively, which were notably higher than those in the biochar samples obtained by direct pyrolysis of RS and FS (3.5\% and 0.5\%), respectively. The water leaching solution of biochar obtained by KHCO3-activated pyrolysis of FS at 600 °C was purified to remove impurity elements, and vivianite with high purity was finally recovered by crystallization. A total P recovery efficiency of 88.08\% was achieved throughout the process from sewage sludge to the final vivianite product. This study proposes a promising and sustainable approach for realizing the recovery of high value-added product vivianite from sewage sludge.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen and phosphorous are indispensable for growth and vitality of living beings, hence termed as nutrients. However, discharge of nutrient rich waste streams to aquatic ecosystems results in eutrophication. Therefore, nutrient removal from wastewater is crucial to meet the strict nutrient discharge standards. Similarly, nutrient recovery from waste streams is vital for the realization of a circular economy by avoiding the depletion of finite resources. This manuscript presents analysis of existing information on different conventional as well as advanced treatment technologies that are commonly practiced for the removal of nutrient from domestic wastewater. First, the information pertaining to the biological nutrient removal technologies are discussed. Second, onsite passive nutrient removal technologies are reviewed comprehensively. Third, advanced nutrient removal technologies are summarized briefly. The mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages of these technologies along with their efficiencies and limitations are discussed. An integrated approach for simultaneous nutrient removal and recovery is recommended. The fifth section of the review highlights bottlenecks and potential solutions for successful implementation of the nutrient removal technologies. It is anticipated that the review will offer an instructive overview of the progress in nutrient removal and recovery technologies and will illustrate necessity of further investigations for development of efficient nutrient removal and recovery processes.},

	abstract = {This work studies the fate of nutrients (N, P, and K) during the hydrothermal treatment of anaerobically digested sewage sludge to raise their concentrations in the liquid phase and facilitate their recovery as solid minerals by chemical precipitation. The hydrothermal process has been optimized by evaluating the temperature (170–230 °C) and reaction time (5–60 min) in an acid-free medium or with the addition of HCl (0.1–0.5 M). In the acid-free hydrothermal reactions, nutrients were mainly concentrated in the hydrochar, which were extracted with 0.5 M HCl (10\% w/v). Following this route, 6.9 g N/kg, 13.8 g P/kg, and 8.8 g K/kg contained in the feedstock were extracted from the hydrochar produced at 230 °C, which, considering direct nutrient solubilization to process water by acid-free hydrothermal treatments, accounts for 82, 83, and 78\% N, P, and K release, respectively. In the HCl-assisted hydrothermal treatment, the release of nutrients directly into the process water was improved and depended mainly on the acid concentration used and to a lesser extent on the reaction temperature. Operating at 230 °C and 0.5 M HCl, the release of 98\% N (more than 45\% as NH4–N), 87\% P (as PO4–P), and 70\% K contained in the feedstock was achieved in the process water. Chemical precipitation of phosphorus and nitrogen from the process water allowed the recovery of a solid identified as crystalline struvite, with high contents in P, Mg, and NH4–N and negligible heavy-metal content. The estimated cost of digested sewage sludge treatment could reach 13.7 euros per tonne, considering the energy inputs required in the hydrothermal treatment.},

	abstract = {The world’s population is estimated to reach 11 billion in this century, with some 8.5 billion living in urban areas. Cities become unprecedented hot spots of demand for virgin water and food, as well as producers of large volumes of valuable waste. The recycling of urban nutrient-rich liquid and solid waste as fertilizer in agriculture will thus be of benefit to both sectors. The analysis suggests that recycling has the potential to become the ultimate sink for organic waste and wastewater, while simultaneously securing the supply of food and fertilizers, and reducing both local and global environmental impacts. Presently, harmful chemical substances from various consumer products in our chemical society are disposed of in urban waste flows and hamper recovery and reuse. A combination of counter measures such as not mixing nutrient-rich blackwater with grey water polluted with chemical compounds, are crucial. The sludge from the small volume of blackwater can contribute enough fertilizers to secure global food supplies by the year 2100. The voluminous grey water will contain few pathogenic microorganisms and can be treated for non-potable reuse. Three urban arrangements are analysed: Singapore (entire city), Helsingborg in Sweden (city district), and Bangalore in India (eco-house).},

The results show that during the solvent separating process of the extraction product, the extract product can be divided into two components, namely light and heavy components, based on the boiling point temperature of 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN) as the dividing point. The yield of heavy components is much higher than that of light components, and it increases significantly with higher PS ratio. Nitrogen-containing compounds are the main chemical compositions of the soluble, accounting for 40.50\% and 45.72\% in the light components of SS and PS extracts, respectively. The addition of PS changes the main chemical compositions of the heavy components of the mixture extracts due to its relatively high content of phenolic compounds and alkanes. When the PS ratio is 50\%, the proportion of apatite inorganic phosphorus (AP) in total phosphorus increases to 82.38\%, which is beneficial for the resource utilization of residues.},

With the focus on closing nutrient cycles, sewage sludge (SS) is a potential source for P recovery. The objective of this study was to produce a mineral P-reach fertilizer. For this purpose, the treatment of SS in a multi-stage process, consisting of a hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and thermochemical post-treatment was examined and compared with a direct thermochemical treatment. The focus was on the transformation of P and the migration of the heavy metals during the processes. In addition, the role of MgCl2 as an additive was examined. During the HTC, most of the P remained in the HTC-char, so that the P content increased in the HTC-char compared with the SS. The addition of MgCl2 to the process resulted in lower transportation rates of P in the liquid phase and higher P solubilities in water, citric acid, and alkalic ammonium citrate out of the solid phase. The thermochemical treatment of SS and the HTC-chars further concentrated P in the ash. Retention rates of {\textgreater}97\% were achieved, and P2O5 contents in the ash were as high as ∼16 wt-\%. The presence of the additive resulted in (i) higher retention rates of P in the ashes (ii) higher P-solubility and (iii) higher removal rates of easily volatile heavy metals such as Pb and Zn, and the treatment of HTC-char favored these effects compared with the direct treatment of SS.},

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem of complex treatment for energy solid waste—biomass ash (BA) from thermal power plant and difficult recovery for phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen in sewage sludge supernatants, a coupled MgO-biomass ash (CMBA) was established. CMBA composites were synthesized by in situ thermal-precipitation modification method, which simultaneously achieved recovery of phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen and BA resource utilization, and explored the potential of recovered CMBA (RCMBA) containing phosphate and ammonia nitrogen to remove heavy metal from wastewater. The results showed that magnesium oxide could be effectively loaded on the surface of BA at an MgCl2 concentration of 1.25 M and calcination temperature of 400 °C. pH, adsorbent dosages and initial concentration affected the adsorption capacity of phosphate and ammonia nitrogen by 400CMBA. The existence of K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions promoted the removal of phosphate by 400CMBA, but hindered the removal of ammonia nitrogen. The existence of Cl-, NO2- and SO42- ions affected the removal of phosphate by 400CMBA. The adsorption processes of 400CMBA for phosphate and ammonia nitrogen can be used with the Langmuir-Freundlich model and the pseudo-second-order model reaching a maximum adsorption capacity of 262.88 mg/g and 122.39 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption behavior was controlled by several processes, spontaneous and thermogenic chemisorption. The saturated adsorbent can be effectively regenerated in 0.1 M HCl solution. After the fifth regeneration, the phosphate and ammonia nitrogen removal rates were less than 50\% and 25\%, respectively. The adsorption mechanisms of phosphate and ammonia nitrogen by 400CMBA were mainly physical adsorption, electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, complexation reaction and chemical precipitation, among which chemical precipitation was dominated by struvite crystallization was dominant. In addition, RCMBA had a specific removal effect on heavy metal in solutions. Overall, this work provides a feasible way for the resource utilization of energy solid waste-BA from thermal power plant.},

	abstract = {Recovering phosphorus from incineration sludge sewage ash (ISSA) is a well-established technology, with a greater recovery potential than that of supernatant or sludge. ISSA can be utilized as a secondary raw material in the fertilizer industry, or as a fertilizer if heavy metal concentrations do not exceed permissible limits, thus reducing the cost of phosphorus recovery. Increasing the temperature to produce ISSA with higher solubility and plant availability of phosphorus is advantageous for both pathways. But a decrease in the extraction of phosphorus is also observed at a high temperature, thereby diminishing the overall economic benefits. In this study, CaCl2 was utilized to mitigate the decrease in the extraction rate and also to promote the bioavailability of phosphorus. The addition of CaCl2 (80 g/kg of dry sludge) effectively promoted the conversion of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus to apatite inorganic phosphorus at a rate of 87.73\% at 750 °C. Furthermore, the decrease in the extraction rate of phosphorus at 1,050 °C was comparatively smaller in the presence of CaCl2. If iron flocculants are used to capture P in wastewater management, it may be necessary to pay special attention to the amount of addition and incineration temperature to maximize the economic potential of recycling.},

	abstract = {Pyrolysis is an emerging and effective means for sludge disposal. Biochar derived from sludge has broad application prospects, however, is limited by heavy metals. In this study, the fate of heavy metals (HMs) in pyrolysis coupling with acid washing treatment for sewage sludge was comprehensively investigated for the first time. Most of the HMs redistributed in the pyrolyzed residues (biochar) after pyrolysis, and the enrichment order of the HMs was: Zn {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Ni {\textgreater} Cr. Compared with various washing agents, phosphoric acid presented a superior washing effect on most heavy metals (Cu, Zn, and Cr) in biochars derived at low pyrolysis temperature and Ni in biochars derived at high pyrolysis temperature. The optimal washing conditions for heavy metals (including Cu, Zn, Cr, and Ni) removal by H3PO4 were obtained by batch washing experiments and the response surface methodology (RSM). The total maximum HM removal efficiency was 95.05\% under the optimal washing specifications by H3PO4 (acid concentration of 2.47 mol/L, L/S of 9.85 mL/g, and a washing temperature of 71.18 °C). Kinetic results indicated that the washing process of heavy metals in sludge and biochars was controlled by a mixture of diffusion and surface chemical reactions. After phosphoric acid washing, the leaching concentrations of HMs in the solid residue were further reduced compared with that of biochar, which were below the USEPA limit value (5 mg/L). The solid residue after pyrolysis coupling with acid washing resulted in a low environmental risk for resource utilization (the values of the potential ecological risk index were lower than 20). This work provides an environmentally friendly alternative of pyrolysis coupling with acid washing treatment for sewage sludge from the viewpoint of the utilization of solid waste.},

Total and diethylene triamine penta acetic acid (DTPA)-extractable concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb increased with increment of temperature. Lower DTPA-extractable concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb were found in biochars compared to the sewage sludge. Pyrolysis decreased bulk density, whereas particle density and porosity increment was observed upon pyrolysis with increment of temperature. Sewage sludge saturated water content (θs) was 130.4 g 100g−1 and significantly greater than biochar, but biochar θs significantly increased with temperature (95.7 versus 105.4 g 100g−1 at 300 and 700°C, respectively). Pyrolysis decreased the biochar’s water repellency, assessed by molarity of ethanol droplet (MED), compared to the sewage sludge. The lowest MED of 0.2 and water repellency rating of 3 were found for the biochar produced at 700°C. Based on our results and considering the energy consumption, pyrolysis temperature in the range of 300–400°C may be suggested for sewage sludge pyrolysis.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) recovery from swine manure by hydrothermal processes has recently attracted considerable interest; however, research has been limited by knowledge gaps and challenges in understanding the mechanisms of soluble and insoluble P transformations and the evaluation of the effects of the reaction conditions. In this study, the transformation mechanisms were investigated and the soluble and insoluble phosphorus distributions in swine manure during the hydrothermal processes were modelled. By increasing the severity of the exogenous conditions, P transformed from insoluble to soluble, and then polymerized with the formation of orthophosphates; meanwhile, the formation of hydrochar was enhanced thereby facilitating further P reclamation. The effects of the endogenous conditions showed there may be a threshold of calcium content, which limited the combination of Ca and P. Calcium ions mainly reacted with P in the form of hydroxyapatite and octacalcium phosphate. The modelling and prediction results showed that a coalification model gives a good fit (RSP2 = 0.9205 and RIP2 = 0.8559) for changes in the concentrations of solid total P and liquid inorganic P. The prediction level of mean absolute error was good as well (MAESP = 0.74 mg g−1 and MAEIP = 0.62 mg g−1). These findings provide a range of scientific opportunities for achieving a comprehensive understanding of the basis of sustainable utilisation of P.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus is an indispensable element, while the existing phosphate rock resources are not enough to maintain the long-term demand of modern agricultural development. To ensure the sustainability of economic and social, it is necessary and urgent to seek the alternative phosphorus source of phosphate rock. In this study, calcined clam shell powder (CSP) was firstly used as a modifier and mixed with sewage sludge (SS) for co-pyrolysis to obtain sludge-derived pyrochars containing a large amount of bioavailable phosphorus. The effect of different temperatures (500, 600, 700, 800 °C) and dosages (0\%, 10\%, 20\%, 30\%) on the change in the form of phosphorus during the pyrolysis process were investigated. With the increase of temperature and the addition of CSP, the orthophosphate (Ortho-P) increased from 63.69\% in the original SS to nearly 100\%. Furthermore, the main phase of inorganic phosphorus (IP) changed, mainly in the form of apatite phosphorus (hydroxyapatite increased from 8.88\% to 35.97\%), and the concentration of easy-to-lose phosphorus reduced to 0.11 mg/g. After co-pyrolysis of SS with CSP, the passivation situation of heavy metals (HMs), such as Zn, Mn, Cr, Cu, Cd and Pb was significantly improved, thus reducing the potential environmental risk. The planting experiment proved that the sludge-derived pyrochars obtained by adding 20\% CSP at 800 °C promoted the germination of seeds and the growth of seedlings. Consequently, the product of SS co-pyrolysis with CSP could be used as an excellently bioavailable and environmentally friendly phosphate fertilizer for agricultural production.},

Correlation (Pearson’s) was observed (i) between electric conductivity and ash content of biochars with the amount of inorganic P species and (ii) between total organic carbon and volatile matter contents with the organic P species.},

            Sewage sludge biochars were obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures from 300°C to 900°C and their macro- and microscale properties were analyzed. The biochar's plant-available nutrients and humus-like substances in the water-extractable phase and fixed nutrients in the solid fraction were evaluated for their potential agronomic implications. FT-IR, Raman, XRD, XPS and SEM techniques were used to investigate the chemical structure, functional groups and microcrystal structure on the surface of the biochar. The results revealed minor chemical changes and dramatic mass loss in the biochar obtained at 300–500°C, whereas significant chemical changes in the biochar were obtained at 600–900°C. The concentrations of plant-available nutrients as well as fulvic- and humic-acid-like materials decreased in the biochar samples obtained at higher temperatures. These results implied that the biochar samples pyrolyzed at 300–500°C could be a direct nutrient source and used to neutralize alkaline soil. The surface area and porosity of the biochar samples increased with temperature, which increased their adsorption capacity. Rearrangement occurred at higher temperature 600–900°C, resulting in the biochar becoming increasingly polyaromatic and its graphite-like carbon becoming organized.},

This paper reports on the potential of pyrolysis treatment to recycle P from renewable materials previously regarded as wastes. The study used K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to examine chemical forms of P in the waste feedstock materials and corresponding biochars (pyrolysis at 480–500 °C) of four ligno-cellulosic, plant-based residues and five relatively P-rich livestock and water-treatment by-products, to acquire information on changes in potential P fertiliser value. Pyrolysis enriched P in the biochars by factors of 1.3–4.3, thus offering wide-ranging P fertiliser potential. XANES spectroscopy revealed hydroxyapatite (HAP) as one of the dominant chemical P compounds in the feedstocks, ranging from 14\% (rice husks) to 98\% (animal bone) of total P. For most materials, pyrolysis increased the proportion of HAP, and pyrophosphates were generated in several cases. These alterations possibly lead to diversity in the P solubility characteristics of the biochars if used as soil amendments; this is an important property of environmentally sound P fertilisers.},

At a gas velocity of 0.0056ms−1 sludge containing a mixture of light yellow and black granules with similar functional groups was quickly formed. The black granules contained crystals of CaCO3, FeS, and Fe2O3 as well as filamentous bacteria that strengthened the particles and reduced the mass transfer resistance. No inorganic crystals were detected in the yellow sludge granules, and their structure was maintained through cohesion mediated by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The light yellow granules were denser and offered better settling performance than the black granules, enhancing the settling properties of the mixed sludge. During a 12-h cycle, the maximum reductions in chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH3–N, and total nitrogen (TN) occurred at 240, 480, and 360min with removal efficiencies of 90\%, 90\%, and 54\%.

	abstract = {The renewable utilization of phosphorus (P) in sewage sludge is greatly hindered by its low bioavailability. In this study, the co-hydrothermal treatment (co-HTT) of sewage sludge and biomass was conducted to enhance P bioavailability. The dehydration and decarboxylation of sludge organic matter were promoted by co-HTT as evidenced by FTIR and elemental analysis. XPS and XRD results showed that co-HTT facilitated the formation of Al/Fe phosphates in sludge. The results of Hedley's sequential extraction demonstrated that HTT at low temperatures (≤ 155 °C) enlarged the relative abundance of bioavailable P in the sludge from 72 \% to as high as 80 \% because of the decomposition of organic P. In contrast, at a high temperature of 185 °C, more bioavailable P was converted into insoluble and residual forms. The addition of rice straw in sludge during HTT resulted in a two-fold increase in exchangeable P content, suggesting that rice straw can effectively improve sludge P bioavailability. Cellulose exhibited less influence on sludge P bioavailability than lignin. After lignin addition, the relative abundance of bioavailable P in the sludge was further increased to 91 \%, which could be attributed to the greater enhancement effect of lignin on the decomposition of sludge organic matter. These findings reveal that the co-HTT of sludge and lignin-containing biomass may be an effective strategy for improving sludge P bioavailability.},

The broad and symmetrical P–O peak in 700 °C biochar (but not at lower pyrolysis temperatures) was attributable to semicrystalline phosphate phases.

Pyrolysis temperature-dependent phosphate release behaviors (400 °C biochar {\textgreater} feedstock {\textgreater} 700 °C biochar) indicated a complex interplay of solid-phase P speciation, dissolved organic carbon concentration, and size-dependent reactivity involving the colloidal fraction of phosphorus phases in biochars.},

	abstract = {X-ray diffraction (XRD) of monolithic pieces of carbonized medium-density fiberboard (c-MDF) provided new insights on the microstructural evolution occurring during charcoal carbonization. Classical XRD theory was used to correlate the \{002\} peak intensity to the amount of carbon in large turbostratic crystallites and to bulk dimensional changes. This new analytical technique could be used to study the microstructural evolution of other monolithic carbon materials (including soft carbons) or of specific processes (including chemical activation). The quasipercolation model, a new ‘percolation-like’ model, was created based on XRD analysis of monolithic c-MDF. As the carbonization temperature (Tcarb) increased above 600°C, the large turbostratic crystallites grew very little, but the graphene sheets grew substantially. Volumetric shrinkage suggested that turbostratic crystallites were drawn closer together as the low-density disordered carbon was converted into high-density graphene sheets. At approximately 900°C, the large graphene sheets and the large turbostratic crystallites significantly impinged on each other. The increased impingement of conductive phases with increasing carbonization temperature would cause the commonly observed nonmetal-metal transition of hard carbon materials. The quasipercolation model also suggested the source of the nanoporosity that is critical in activated carbons.},

	abstract = {In this study a set of 10 coals varying in rank and maceral composition has been devolatilised in a flat flame burner at 1000 and 1300°C in order to investigate the changes in char reactivity and structure as a function of pyrolysis temperature. The intrinsic reactivity of the chars, measured isothermally in a thermobalance at 500°C, has been related to the petrographic characteristics of the chars and their CO2 surface areas. The temperature of pyrolysis has shown to have a strong effect on char reactivity for certain coals. Overall, the increase of temperature provoked an enhanced plasticity and a more extensive consolidation during the metaplast stage of pyrolysis and reduced the amount of unfused material in the chars. This effect was more pronounced in low volatile bituminous vitrinites and low rank inertinites. The presence of inertinite derived materials in high rank coal chars enhanced their reactivities, whereas the opposite was observed for low rank coal chars. This was attributed to the fact that inertinite macerals yield both isotropic and anisotropic materials: inertinite in low rank coals increases the amount of anisotropic, less reactive char, but reduces it in high rank coals.},

	abstract = {Background and aims Biochars are highly variable in nutrient composition and availability, which are determined by types of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. The aim of this research was to (a) study the bioavailability of phosphorus (P) in biochars using different feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions; (b) develop a robust chemical method for biochar P availability measurements. Methods In the present study, (a) chemical analysis – including total P and extractable P (2\% citric acid, 2\% formic acid, and neutral ammonium citrate extraction), and (b) a bioassay test using rye-grass grown in a P deficient sandy soil were used to compare the P bioavailability of different biochars. Biochars were produced from two different feedstocks (dairy manure-wood mixture, MAe; biosolid-wood mixture, BSe) at four different pyrolysis temperatures (250, 350, 450, and 550°C). Results Results showed that P in feedstock was fully recovered in the biochars. After 6 harvests, the biochars were as effective as the P fertilizers tested [Sechura phosphate rocks (SPR) and calcium dihydrogen phosphate (CaP)] in increasing the shoot yield. However, P uptake followed the order of CaP {\textgreater}MAe biochars {\textgreater}BSe biochars {\textgreater}SPR, on a same TP basis. Based on the Mitscherlich equation, 2\% formic acid was the most sensitive indicator of P bioavailability in biochars. Conclusions The results suggest that high-ash biochars with high P concentrations are potential P sources with high-agronomic efficiency. We propose the use of 2\% formic acid extraction to predict the availability of P in ash-rich biochars.},

	abstract = {Biochar, as a soil amendment, can increase concentrations of soil organic matter, especially water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC). This can affect the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dissolved solid phases in soil organic matter. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) represents a small proportion of soil organic matter, but is of significant importance in the soil ecosystem due to its mobility and reactivity. Here, water extracts obtained from twelve non-herbaceous biochars (before, and after, chemical treatment with either H3PO4 or KOH), were tested by Liquid Chromatography – Organic Carbon Detection (LC–OCD) to identify the effects of both pyrolysis conditions and chemical treatments on WEOC content. LC–OCD has the capacity to provide a fingerprint of WEOC, which allows analysis of the various fractions present. WEOC content was affected by both the pyrolysis temperature and the feedstock used. High mineral ash contents deriving from the feedstock can prompt thermochemical reactions of lignocelluloses to produce a relatively high WEOC content, which includes low molecular weight neutrals and humic acids as dominant components. A significant change in WEOC occurred during pyrolysis due to secondary reactions which resulted in a much lower WEOC in the high temperature biochars where fractions of low molecular weight acids and neutrals are dominant. Chemical treatments with H3PO4 or KOH increased WEOC concentration, possibly by promoting hydrolysis reactions on biochar surfaces. These observations assist in assessing the contribution of biochar additions to the soil ecosystem and demonstrate the utility of LC–OCD in providing an understanding of how biochar additions to soil can alter DOC.},

The XPS, TGA, and H2O2 oxidation were applied to evaluate effects of the interaction on the stability of biochar. Fe8O8(OH)8Cl1.35 and AlCl3·6H2O were newly formed on the biochar surface or inside of the biochar pores. At the biochar-mineral interface, organometallic complexes such as Fe–O–C were generated. All the 4 minerals enhanced the oxidation resistance of biochar surface by decreasing the relative contents of C–O, C═O, and COOH from 36.3\% to 16.6–26.5\%. Oxidation resistance of entire biochar particles was greatly increased with C losses in H2O2 oxidation decreasing by 13.4–79.6\%, and the C recalcitrance index (R50,bicohar) in TGA analysis increasing from 44.6\% to 45.9–49.6\%. Enhanced oxidation resistance of biochar surface was likely due to the physical isolation from newly formed minerals, while organometallic complex formation was probably responsible for the increase in oxidation resistance of entire biochar particles. Results indicated that mineral-rich soils seemed to be a beneficial environment for biochar since soil minerals could increase biochar stability, which displays an important environmental significance of biochar for long-term carbon sequestration.},

	abstract = {The structure of carbon fractions and its characterization are critical for practical applications of the sewage sludge-derived biochar. However, the endogenous mineral constituents in sewage sludge can largely affect the structural characterization of carbon fractions in the obtained biochar. In this study, the high-mineral sludge biochar together with the biochar after acid washing was employed to explicate the effects of silicon- and aluminum-containing minerals on the structural characterization of carbon fractions. Results from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that major minerals such as kaolinite, metakaolin and quartz can obscure the presentation of functional groups and crystalline structure of carbon fractions. Peak deconvolution of Raman spectra demonstrated that both positions and peak area ratios of G and D bands were affected by the signals of aluminosilicates. Furthermore, aromatic rings developed and condensed with the increase in pyrolysis temperatures, leading to a gradual increase in structural ordering and the formation of turbostratic structures with poor crystalline and short-ranged orders. In addition, the effect of mineral constituents on physicochemical properties was related with pyrolysis temperature, which showed an enlargement in porosity at high temperatures (500–700 °C) but a more closely-packed powder mixture for low-temperature biochar (200–400 °C). From the interference of mineral constituents on temperature-dependent structure characterization of biochar carbon fractions, this study showed the necessity to explore interactions between mineral and carbon fractions to enhance potential application of high-mineral biochars.},

ClO4– adsorption was controlled by the surface polarities and structural compositions of the organic components of biochars, rather than their inorganic mineral components. FB500-FB700 biochars with low polarity and high aromaticity displayed a superior ClO4– adsorption capacity, but which was affected by solution pH. Besides electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding to oxygen-containing groups on biochars was proposed the dominant force for perchlorate adsorption, which led to the maximum adsorption occurring near pHIEP, where surface charge equals zero. The dissociation of these surface oxygen-containing groups was monitored by zeta potential curves, which indicated that the H-bonds donors on biochar surface for ClO4– binding were changed from −COOH (ClO4–···HOOC−) and −OH (ClO4–···HO−) to −OH alone with an increase in pH. The H-bond force was strengthened by the condensed aromatic surfaces, since high temperature biochars provided a hydrophobic microenvironment to accommodate weakly hydrated perchlorate and facilitated the H-bonds for ClO4– binding to functional groups by the large π subunit of their aromatic substrate. Lastly, the batch and column tests of ClO4– adsorption showed that biochars like FB700 are effective adsorbents for anion pollutant removal via H-bonding interaction.},

	abstract = {Quantification of phosphorus (P) and determination of the occurrence forms of P in solid fuels are important to thermochemical processing of P-containing solid fuels. This study has developed a new three-step method for separating and quantifying the total P in a solid fuel into five major P-containing fractions. These consist of three organic P-containing fractions (i.e., acid-soluble organic P, two acid-insoluble organic P including P in lipids and P in nucleic acids and other acid-insoluble organic structures) and two inorganic P-containing fractions (i.e., acid-soluble inorganic P and acid-insoluble inorganic P). The first step of this new method uses cold 0.6 M HClO4 to extract the acid-soluble P species. The extracted solution is then neutralized, followed by selectively converting the acid-soluble organic P in the solution into orthophosphate (PO43–), pyrophosphate (P2O74–), and tripolyphosphate (P3O105–) by UV irradiation in the presence of H2O2. The second step of this new method uses an ethanol/chloroform mixture to extract the residue from the first step to yield a solution for quantifying the contents of P in acid-insoluble phospholipids using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The third step of this new method uses buffered NaCl solution at 100 °C to extract P in nucleic acids and other acid-insoluble organic structures from the residue of the second step into a solution for subsequent quantification using ICP-OES. The acid-insoluble inorganic P in the residue is then quantified using ICP-OES after HF/HNO3/H2O2 acid digestion. The new method is validated with a comprehensive set of standard samples loaded with known amounts of single or mixed P-containing species with known occurrence forms. Compared to the large errors of the conventional Standards, Measurements and Testing method, complete P recovery is achieved with minimal errors. Further applications of the new method to seven different solid fuels also achieve close to 100\% mass balance of P. The results demonstrate that the new method is suitable for quantifying various forms of P in solid fuels.},

This study aimed to develop a robust and easy method to characterize and quantify the biochar-DOC, using water-, acid-, and base-extractable DOC samples (WEOC, AEOC, and BEOC respectively) from 46 biochars produced from diverse feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions. BEOC concentrations were the highest (2.3–139 mg-C/g-biochar), followed by WEOC (0.5–40 mg-C/g-biochar) and AEOC (0.2–23 mg-C/g-biochar). Fast-pyrolysis biochars generally had higher DOC concentrations than slow-pyrolysis biochars. DOC concentrations in slow-pyrolysis biochars decreased exponentially with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 600 °C. The solid-state 13C NMR showed that biochar-DOC had abundant small fused-ring aromatics, aliphatic C, and carboxyl C. Biochar-DOC included an acid-precipitated (AP) fraction of higher molecular weight and aromaticity and an acid-soluble (AS) fraction of lower molecular weight and aromaticity. BEOC generally had a greater AP fraction than WEOC and AEOC. Molecular weight, aromaticity and composition of AEOC and BEOC differed from those of more environmentally-relevant WEOC, suggesting that the acid- and base-extraction may not produce the DOC released in real soils.

	abstract = {Phosphorus sequestration in wetland soils is a prerequisite for long-term maintenance of water quality in downstream aquatic systems, but can be compromised if phosphorus is released following changes in nutrient status or hydrological regimen. The association of phosphorus with relatively refractory natural organic matter (e.g., humic substances) might protect soil phosphorus from such changes. Here we used hydrofluoric acid (HF) pretreatment to remove phosphorus associated with metals or anionic sorption sites, allowing us to isolate a pool of phosphorus associated with the soil organic fraction. Solution 31P and solid state 13C NMR spectra for wetland soils were acquired before and after hydrofluoric acid pretreatment to assess quantitatively and qualitatively the changes in phosphorus and carbon functional groups. Organic phosphorus was largely unaffected by HF treatment in soils dominated by refractory alkyl and aromatic carbon groups, indicating association of organic phosphorus with stable, humified soil organic matter. Conversely, a considerable decrease in organic phosphorus following HF pretreatment was detected in soils where O-alkyl groups represented the major fraction of the soil carbon. These correlations suggest that HF treatment can be used as a method to distinguish phosphorus fractions that are bound to the inorganic soil components from those fractions that are stabilized by incorporation into soil organic matter.},

In addition, a pyrolysis temperature of 300°C resulted in the most reduction in DTPA-extractable metals of SDBCs, owing to the organo-metallic complex formed with the abundant presence of functional groups and available phosphorus content, which were easily decomposed or degraded at higher temperatures.},

Batch studies indicated that a combination of mixed salts and thermal treatments imparted the modified NCAP (named NCAP-NM) with the maximum nitrogen and phosphorus sorption capacity. This versatile adsorbent displayed a very fast nutrient adsorption rate and can, after 1h of adsorption, lower a solution enriched with 20mg/L of nutrients to {\textless}0.01mg P/L and 0.354mgN/L with a dosage of 30g/L. Fixed column adsorption studies indicated that sorption of phosphate was predominately affected by HCO3−, while sorption of ammonium was predominately affected by Ca2+. The result of a real-world application indicated that NCAP-NM could purify 1440 and 1000 bed volumes of water for phosphate and ammonium, respectively, in eutrophic river water treatment. While SEM-EDS and XPS analysis confirmed a dual function in the nutrient removal process utilizing NCAP-NM where phosphate was removed through precipitation by calcium, and ammonium was exchanged with magnesium and sodium in the adsorbent. These results offer a promising new method for lake eutrophication control if NCAP-NM is used as the adsorbent for nitrogen and phosphorus removal.},

Findings from batch sorption experiments suggested that, although sorption of P on the biochar was controlled by relatively slow kinetics, the maximum P sorption capacity of the biochar could reach {\textgreater}100 mg·g–1. Mathematical modeling and postsorption characterization results indicated that the sorption was mainly controlled by two mechanisms: precipitation of P through chemical reaction with Mg particles and surface deposition of P on Mg crystals on biochar surfaces. Most of the P retained in the engineered biochar was bioavailable and could be released equally at multiple successive extractions. In addition, the P-laden biochar significantly stimulated grass seed germination and growth. These results suggested the postsorption biochar can be cycled back directly to soils as an effective slow-release P-fertilizer.},

P-doped AC was prepared by impregnating AC with H3PO4 (1 M) and then heating at 200 °C, 400 °C, 600 °C, 800 °C and 1000 °C, respectively in the presence of nitrogen. The pretreatment of AC increased the power density of MFCs by 75\% from 730 ± 23 mW m−2 (RAW-SP, untreated AC) to 1278 ± 56 mW m−2 (SP-800, heated at 800 °C). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the successful doping of P in all treated samples, and the introduction of oxygen-containing groups contributed to the increase of power densities and ORR performance. Raman spectra analysis indicated that the AC structure was deformed by the doped P atom. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the treated samples revealed a higher graphitization degree than the control. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also showed that the introduction of the P heteroatom reduced the total resistance, which contributed to the improved electrochemical performance. However, high temperature could destroy the AC's structure, which led to the decline of BET surface area and micropore volume. Thus, P-doped AC would be a promising electrocatalyst for the ORR in MFCs.},

	abstract = {The inhibition effectiveness of thermally deposited phosphorus (P) compounds on the carbon oxidation catalyzed by potassium or calcium acetate has been investigated. The P deposit was formed by impregnating carbon/carbon composite samples with methanol solution of methyl-phosphoric acid or phosphorus oxychloride and heating at ca. 600°C. An amorphous layer formed by a relatively large amount of P deposit functioned as a barrier for the access of the catalyst to the carbon surface even though it had almost no barrier effect for O2 access. The catalytic effect of calcium was almost completely suppressed by such deposit, but the effect of potassium was only partially suppressed due to the superior wetting ability and mobility of potassium species. Small amounts of P deposit showed similar inhibition effects on non-catalyzed oxidation, while their effects on catalytic oxidation were not as good. Characterization of P-deposited carbon samples by XPS, XRD, SEM and TPD, as well as ab initio MO calculations, suggested that the inhibition effect mainly resulted from the formation of oxygen-containing P groups which may include metaphosphates, C–O–PO3 groups and C–PO3 groups. Those groups are suggested to act as a physical barrier against carbon/catalyst interfacial contact as well as to block the active carbon sites. The presence of bridge oxygen bonded to a carbon site and a P group appears to be a critical factor for maintaining the inhibition effect. Indeed, the loss of such oxygen or connecting bond seems to result in loss of inhibition.},

SiO2 and Al2O3 are the main inorganic oxides of SS and RS. Little is known about their effects on LWA performance, although they are known to contribute to the formation of the basic skeleton structure. The main objective of this research was to systematically evaluate the effects of variations in SiO2 and Al2O3 content on characteristics of LWA, including physical characteristics, morphological structures, crystal phases, and stabilization of heavy metals. Our studies showed that LWA with the highest compressive strength, lowest porosity, and best solidification of heavy metals can be obtained with a SiO2 content between 30\% and 45\% and an Al2O3 content between 11\% and 19\%. Heavy metals were encapsulated within the aluminosilicate matrix structure when LWA pellets were sintered at 1100°C, indicating that harmful heavy metals can be solidified safely within LWA to increase the security, stability, and reliability of its application. Experimental results illustrated that SiO2 and Al2O3 are potentially crucial parameters that can control the physicochemical properties of LWA.},

Results show that WWTS and DWTS can be utilized as resources for producing ceramsite with optimal contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 ranging 14−26\% and 22.5−45\%, respectively. Ceramsite within the optimal SiO2 and Al2O3 contents ranges was characterized using thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), morphological structures analyses, and compressive strength measurements. Significant weight loss below 600 °C is through the release of structural water and gases. Bloating and crystallization in ceramsite above 900 °C are caused by the oxidation and volatilization of inorganic substances. Higher strength ceramsite with less Na−Ca feldspars and amorphous silica and more densified surfaces can be obtained at 18\% ≤ Al2O3 ≤ 26\% and 30\% ≤ SiO2 ≤ 45\%, while porous ceramsite with complex crystalline phases and lower strength can be obtained at 14\% ≤ Al2O3 {\textless} 18\% and 22.5\% ≤ SiO2 {\textless} 30\%.

With an understanding of the limits and possible issues with using AdC for charge referencing purposes and by incorporating other methodologies (Auger parameter, checks for data self-consistency, well-established peak-fitting routines) it was found that using AdC C 1s for charge referencing gave satisfactory and meaningful results in 95\% of the 522 cases assessed.

	abstract = {Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed in order to determine the removal behaviour of the heavy metals Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn from sewage sludge ash by adding Cl and performing a thermal treatment process. FactSage 5.3.1 and ChemSheet 1.5 are thermodynamic equilibrium calculation programs which were used to design a multicomponent thermodynamic system on the basis of the mass flows (sewage sludge ash–additive mixture and gases) obtained from experiments with a methane-fired laboratory-scale rotary kiln. In a first step the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations performed were validated by the experimental results and in a second step the calculations should serve for the understanding of the heavy metal removal processes in order to realise a technical application. The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed in the temperature range from 500 to 1000°C using three variations of Cl addition (0, 5 and 10wt\%) in the sewage sludge ash. With regard to their calculated removal results, the heavy metals investigated can be classified into three fractions, namely “easily volatile” (Cd and Pb), “semi-volatile” (Cu and Zn) and “low-volatile” heavy metals (Cr and Ni). The calculations indicate good compliance with experimental results for “easily volatile” and “low-volatile” heavy metals (Cr and Ni). For the “semi-volatile” fraction (Cu and Zn) the removal calculations showed the largest deviations from the measurement results due to kinetic effects. Nevertheless, calculations give clear removal trends for all heavy metals regarded and allow recommendations for a technical application of industrial-scale. According to calculations and the finding that Cu, Pb and Zn indicate higher removal rates at higher temperatures, “easily” and “semi-volatile heavy metals” should be removed at a treatment temperature of 1000°C in directly heated systems. In the case of “easily volatile heavy metals”, chlorination is not implicitly necessary. They are volatilised in form of hydroxides and/or oxides. In contrast to this fraction, “semi-volatile heavy metals” require high amounts of Cl addition (at least 10wt\% in the ash–additive mixture) for their volatilisation as chlorides. Furthermore, a flue gas poor in H2O and sewage sludge ash rich in Si may positively influence the removal. Even a Cl addition of 10wt\% in combination with a treatment temperature of 1000°C in directly heated systems is not sufficient for the removal of “low-volatile heavy metals”. Both Cr and Ni require a flue gas without H2O and a specific chemical composition (high contents of Si, low contents of Fe) of the sewage sludge ash used for high-removal rates. Following, indirectly heated systems (where the reactor atmosphere can be adjusted more easily) and a treatment temperature of 1000°C are recommended for the removal of Cr and Ni.},

	abstract = {Biochars produced by pyrolysis at high temperatures under oxygen limited conditions can contain both wellknown contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), potentially toxic elements (PTEs), dioxins, volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) and emerging contaminants (e.g., persistent free radicals, metal cyanide). Their potential to induce phytotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and neurotoxicity highlight the need to establish effective strategies to control and eliminate contaminants for sustainable biochar use. Although some articles have reviewed the ecotoxic potential of biochar in relation to some of these contaminants, strategies to mitigate the whole suite of contaminants potentially present in biochar have not been systematically reviewed so far. This review discusses (i) the formation mechanism of such contaminants and (ii) evaluates their potential risk to ecosystems, a prerequisite (iii) to understand and explore effective control strategies for producing biochars with minimum contamination. A pyrolysis unit design where pyrolysis liquids and solids are fully separated following the pyrolysis zone and optimization of pyrolysis parameters ensures organic contaminants in the pyrolysis liquids do not condense onto the biochar. Post-production treatments, such as thermal treatment or natural and artificial ageing help organic contaminant removal and breakdown. Co-pyrolysis of metal-rich feedstock with metal-free biomass is the only way of reducing total PTE levels, though available PTE levels are low in biochars and decrease further with pyrolysis temperature. More specific strategies for reducing the concentration of individual contaminants are discussed in the review. With our proposed recommendations, biochars with little risk for the environment can be produced.},

As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the char yield decreased, the tar yield increased then decreased, and the gas yield increased.

	abstract = {Sewage sludge (SS) is a frequent and challenging issue for countries with big populations, due to its massive output, significant hazard potential, and challenging resource utilization. Pyrolysis can simultaneously realize the reduction, harmlessness and recycling of SS. Co-pyrolysis offers a wide range of potential in terms of increasing product quality and immobilizing heavy metals (HMs), thanks to its capacity to use additives to address the mismatch between SS characteristics and pyrolysis. High-value utilization potential of SS biochar is the key to evaluating the advancement of treatment technology. A further requirement for using biochar resources is the immobilization and bioavailability reduction of HMs. Due to the catalytic and synergistic effects in the co-pyrolysis process, co-pyrolysis SS biochar exhibits enhanced functionality and has been applied in soil improvement, pollutant adsorption and catalytic reactions. This review focuses on the research progress of different additives in improving the functionality of biochar and influencing the behavior of HMs. The key limitation and challenges in SS co-pyrolysis are then discussed. Future research prospects are detailed from seven perspectives, including pyrolysis process optimization, co-pyrolysis additive selection, catalytic mechanism research of process and product, biochar performance improvement and application field expansion, cooperative immobilization of HMs, and life cycle assessment. This review will offer recommendations and direction for future research paths, while also assist pertinent researchers in swiftly understanding the current state of SS pyrolysis research field.},

Pyrolysis enhanced aromatization and increased stability of biochar, and part of oxygen-containing functional groups decomposed. Although heavy metals enriched in pyrolysis, high temperatures promoted the bioavailable fractions converted to more stable ones, and the heavy metals leaching rate was reduced by 5.5\% on average. This may be related to the functional group decomposition, pore collapse and wrapping, and the new crystalline phases formation. The environmental risk was significantly reduced (RI value below 51.00), indicating the relatively safe and reliable performance of sludge biochar.

However, the surface area is reduced for chars obtained at 550–650°C, possibly owing to the pore enlargement phenomenon as a result of loss of volatiles in the intermediate thermoplastic phase. Reduction in mesopore volume due to sintering at high temperatures and prolonged times was also observed.

The functional groups and condensable/non-condensable gases (O-H, C=O, C-O, C-H benzene skeleton, CO, CO2) were detected by FTIR, revealing the synergistic effect on the evolution of condensable/non-condensable gases in the promotion of C-O, C=O and CO2 release in blends. The condensable and non-condensable products were detected via MS (including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, CO2, NOx and SOx). The results showed that CO2 was the main gaseous product and confirmed an enhancement of the CO2 release during co-pyrolysis.

	abstract = {Using cherry stones (CS) as starting material and commonly air as activating agent, formation of oxygen structures in activated carbon is investigated. In the preparation of samples, CS was first heated at temperatures between 450 and 900°C in N2 atmosphere. Then, in a successive activation stage, the product carbonized at 600°C was maintained in contact with an air stream at 25–325°C for 24 h, 300–600°C for 1 h, and 250°C for 1–96 h. The rest of the carbonization products of CS were also heated at 250°C in air for 24 h. Moreover, the product carbonized at 900°C was activated at 750 or 900°C in CO2 for 1 h. Furthermore, in a second activation stage, the products activated at such temperatures in CO2 and those at 300–600°C in air were heated at 250°C in air for 24 h. The starting material, carbonized products, and activated carbons were examined by FT-IR spectroscopy. A number of carbon–hydrogen atomic groupings and of oxygen groups and structures, i.e., OH, CO, and C–O–C) have been identified in CS. The yield of the activation and carbonization processes and also the chemical structure of the resultant products are strongly dependent on the carbonization temperature. In the products carbonized at 600–900°C, only ether type structures are detected. The activation at 250°C in air results in activated carbons that contain different oxygen structures when CS is carbonized at 450 or 600°C. At 750 or 900, by contrast, oxygen structures are not formed as a result of the activation treatment. This also applies when the carbonization product of CS at 900°C is activated solely in CO2 or first in CO2 and then in air. The heating conditions in air greatly influence the formation of oxygen structures (specifically, of lactonic and ion-radical types) to a large extent. It only occurs when activating at relatively low temperatures for a long time; at 300–600°C for 1 h, however, the oxygen structures are not formed.},

During cellulose pyrolysis, although the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds are slightly stronger, both intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds can break at low temperatures (i.e., {\textgreater}120 °C), leading to the formation of free hydroxyl. Due to the weakened hydrogen bonds in cellulose, dehydration reactions firstly take place to produce saturated carbonyls, at a lower temperature (i.e., 240 °C) for amorphous cellulose. At increased temperatures (i.e., {\textgreater}270 °C), the hydrogen bonds in cellulose reduce more significantly, promoting the decomposition of glucopyranose rings to form double bonds (i.e., carbonyls, carboxyls and conjugated alkenes). Compared to those for amorphous cellulose, the hydrogen bonds in crystalline cellulose are more stable, thus protecting the functional groups (i.e., CH groups, glycosidic bonds and glucopyranose rings) from rapid disruption.},

Intensity and directionality in both real (synchronous) and imaginary (asynchronous) coordinates of 2D infrared correlation spectra were confirmed by the time courses of pyrolysis reaction (temperature × wavenumber × absorbance; 10 °C min–1, 1 h residence time at 500 °C) utilizing high-density (74 total spectra) in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform (DRIFTs) monitoring. Similar primary trends were observed for four different lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks: cottonseed hull, cotton ginning waste, flax shive, and pecan shell. In the OH stretch region (3100–3750 cm–1), free OH was most sensitive to pyrolysis temperature and reacted before H-bonded OH indicating the evaporation of water, followed by the cleavage of interchain H-bonds. Aromatic CH (R=CHn) was the primary CH functionality (within 2700–3100 cm–1) impacted by the pyrolysis temperature perturbation and formed as the aliphatic CHx was removed. Of C=O/C=C groups, electron-deficient C=O (1740 cm–1) was most sensitive to pyrolysis, reacted synchronously (in the same direction) with the aromatic C=C (1510 cm–1), and was formed after the most electron-rich C=O (1620 cm–1). This electron-density trend in the C=O/C=C (1400–1800 cm–1) region of infrared coincided with the formation of aromatic extractable carbon before aliphatic structures in 2D fluorescence emission–emission correlation spectra using 340 nm excitation wavelength. Results could be used to drive biomass pyrolysis toward desirable solid- (carboxyl-enriched biochar) and liquid-phase (less hydrophilic bio-oil) products.},

	abstract = {Transmission Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy was used to compare organic soil layers originating from three different sites in two climatic regions. A variety of bands characteristic of molecular structures and functional groups have been identified for these samples from a humic podsol, a dystric cambisol and a spodo dystric cambisol. Similar results were obtained for all three soils. From L to H soil horizons, an increase of the band at 1630 cm−1 and decrease of bands in the region from 1510 cm−1 to 1230 cm−1 were observed. The band at 1630 cm−1 can be assigned to carboxylic and aromatic groups. The decline of the peak intensity at 1510 cm−1 is significantly correlated to the total carbon content and CN ratio. The mineral material of the Ah horizons leads to an increase of the band at 1050 cm−1 due to IR-absorbance of the SiO bond and to an appearance of bands in the region from 900 to 400 cm−1, which are characteristic for clay and quartz minerals. Analysis of the FTIR absorbance showed that intensities of distinct peaks (e.g., at 1510 cm−1) can be a measure of decomposition of forest litter. Therefore, the proposed simple FTIR method has potential for identification and differentiation of organic soil horizons originating from known tree litter. The similarity of the characteristics of the spectra of the three soil profiles investigated suggests a broad applicability of this method to distinguish organic forest soil horizons. On the basis of the data presented in this study, it may be concluded that FTIR spectroscopy offers a simple, powerful, non-destructive tool for the investigation of decomposition of L to H horizons in forest soils.},

Increasing demand for fertilizers, signs of geopolitical constraints, and high discharge of P to waterbodies are the other reasons to pursue the circularity of P. Various research have been carrying out and several processes have been developed for P-recovery from different resources. However, there is still a huge unexplored potential for P-recovery specially in the regional framework from the four main P-rich waste resources: food waste, manure, mining waste, and sewage sludge. This study reviews recovery methods of P from these secondary resources comprehensively. Additionally, it analyzes the Nordic viewpoint of P-cycle by evaluating Nordic reserves, demands, and secondary resources to gain a systematic assessment of how Nordic countries could move toward circular economy of P. Results of this study show that secondary resources of P in Nordic countries have the potential of replacing mineral fertilizer in these countries to a considerable extent. However, to overcome the challenges of P-recovery from studied resources, policymakers and researchers need to take decisions and make innovation along each other to open the new possibilities for Nordic economy.},

Solid-state 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was applied to demineralized sediment samples from sites overlain by oxic and anoxic bottom waters. The two sites were similar in terms of key diagenetic parameters, including the mass accumulation rate, integrated sulfate reduction rate, and bulk sediment organic carbon content. In contrast, P benthic fluxes were much higher at the anoxic site. 31P NMR results show that P esters and phosphonates are the major organic P species present at the surface and at depth in sediments at both sites. Polyphosphates were only found in the surface sediment of the site overlain by oxic waters. The varying stability of polyphosphates in microorganisms under different redox conditions may, in part, explain their distribution as well as differences in P flux between the two sites.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) recycling or reuse by pyrolyzing crop residue has recently elicited increased research interest. However, the effects of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions on P species have not been fully understood. Such knowledge is important in identifying the agronomic and environmental uses of biochar. Residues of three main Chinese agricultural crops and the biochars (produced at 300°C–600°C) derived from these crops were used to determine P transformations during pyrolysis. Hedley sequential fractionation and 31P NMR analyses were used in the investigation. Our results showed that P transformation in biochar was significantly affected by pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock (Wheat straw, maize straw and peanut husk). Pyrolysis treatment transformed water soluble P into a labile (NaHCO3-Pi) or semi-labile pool (NaOH-Pi) and into a stable pool (Dil. HCl P and residual-P). At the same time, organic P was transformed into inorganic P fractions which was identified by the rapid decomposition of organic P detected with solution 31P NMR. The P transformation during pyrolysis process suggested more stable P was formed at a higher pyrolysis temperature. This result was also evidenced by the presence of less soluble or stable P species, such as such as poly-P, crandallite (CaAl3(OH)5(PO4)2) and Wavellite (Al3(OH)3(PO4)2·5H2O), as detected by solid-state 31P NMR in biochars formed at a higher pyrolysis temperature. Furthermore, a significant proportion of less soluble pyrophosphate was identified by solution (2\%–35\%) and solid-state (8\%–53\%) 31P NMR, which was also responsible for the stable P forms at higher pyrolysis temperature although their solubility or stability requires further investigation. Results suggested that a relatively lower pyrolysis temperature retains P availability regardless of feedstock during pyrolysis process.},

Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) multiquantum (MQ) MAS 27Al was used to obtain high spectral resolution, which provided a guide for analyzing quantitative 1D 27Al NMR spectra. Six aluminum sites were resolved in the 2D MQ MAS NMR spectra, and seven aluminum sites were required to fit the 1D spectra. A set of octahedral and tetrahedral peaks with well-defined quadrupolar line shapes was observed in the θ-phase dominant sample and was unambiguously assigned to the θ-Al2O3 phase. The distinct line shapes related to the θ-Al2O3 phase provided an opportunity for effectively deconvoluting the more complex spectrum obtained from the δ-Al2O3 dominant sample, allowing the peaks/quadrupolar parameters related to the δ-Al2O3 phase to be extracted. The results show that the δ-Al2O3 phase contains three distinct AlO sites and three distinct AlT sites. This detailed Al site structural information offers a powerful way of analyzing the most complex γ-Al2O3 spectrum. It is found that the γ-Al2O3 phase consists of Al sites with local structures similar to those found in the δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 phases albeit with less ordering. Spin–lattice relaxation time measurement further confirms the disordering of the lattice. Collectively, this study uniquely assigns 27Al features in transition aluminas, offering a simplified method to quantify complex mixtures of aluminum sites in transition alumina samples.},

Adjuvants were prepared by two different methods: batch-precipitation and precipitation at constant pH, using a wide range of different conditions. The adjuvant compositions showed no evident stoichiometric restrictions and varied as a function of the precipitation conditions. All the aluminum hydroxyphosphate adjuvants were found by 27Al MAS NMR to contain both tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated aluminum. The octahedral form was always predominant. The chemical shifts corresponding to octahedral aluminum were at values intermediate between that of aluminum hydroxide (9 ppm) and those of phosphate-containing aluminum minerals such as variscite (−9 ppm) and varied with the phosphate content of the adjuvant. This was true even for adjuvants precipitated above pH 6 indicating that the phosphate is incorporated into the bulk solid phase contrary to predictions in the literature. Aside from the presence of tetrahedral and octahedral aluminum, there was no evidence in any of the adjuvants of distinct, structurally defined phases indicating that the adjuvants are not mixtures of distinct phases which differ significantly in the number of phosphorus atoms in the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) position to aluminum. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 89: 311–321, 2000},

	abstract = {Synthetic transition aluminas (χ, κ, θ, γ, δ, η, ρ) exhibit unique adsorptive and catalytic properties leading to numerous practical applications. Generated by thermal transformation of aluminium (oxy)hydroxides, structural differences between them arise from the variability of aluminium coordination numbers and degree of dehydroxylation. Unequivocal identification of these phases using X-ray diffraction has proven to be very difficult. Quadrupolar interactions of 27Al nuclei, highly sensitive to each site symmetry, render advanced 27Al solid-state NMR a unique spectroscopic tool to fingerprint and identify the different phases. In this paper, 27Al NMR spectroscopic data on alumina reported in literature are collected in a comprehensive library. Based on this dataset, a new 3D correlative method of NMR parameters is presented, enabling fingerprinting and identification of such phases. Providing a gold standard from crystalline samples, this approach demonstrates that any sort of crystalline, ill crystallized or amorphous, mixed periodic or aperiodically ordered transition alumina can now be assessed beyond the current limitations of characterisation. Adopting the presented approach as a standard characterisation of alumina samples will readily reveal NMR parameter–structure–property relations suitable to develop new or improved applications of alumina. Methodological guidance is provided to assist consistent implementation of this characterisation throughout the fields involved.},

	abstract = {Biochar produced by pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) is considered as a great resource for P recycling. However, the unclear transformation mechanism of phosphorus species during pyrolysis limits the further application of biochar. The study systematically investigated the effects of pyrolysis temperature (300 − 500 ℃) and additives (CaO and MgO) on P speciation in SS and its derived biochar, proposed the transformation pathways of P and clarified its transformation mechanism. The results indicated that the ester bonds in orthophosphate diesters were broken before 400 ℃ to form orthophosphate monoesters and pyrophosphate. Various P forms in SS were gradually converted to Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, Ca9Al(PO4)7, and Ca3(PO4)2. The addition of CaO further promoted the formation of Ca− P, and the maximum of Ca− P was 2.5 times than that of pyrolysis alone. Phosphorus mainly existed in the forms of Ca3(PO4)2. The promoting effect of MgO on the formation of apatite phosphorus (AP) was not as obvious as CaO. The study provides more theoretical support for the feasibility of SS-pyrolysis biochar for agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a thermochemical conversion technique which is attractive due to its ability to transform wet biomass into energy and chemicals without predrying. The solid product, known as hydrochar, has received attention because of its ability to prepare precursors of activated carbon in wastewater pollution remediation, soil remediation applications, solid fuels, and other carbonaceous materials. Besides the generally lignocellulose biomass used as sustainable feedstock, HTC has been applied to a wide range of derived waste, including sewage sludge, algae, and municipal solid waste to solve practical problems and generate desirable carbonaceous products. This review presented the critical hydrothermal parameters of HTC, including temperature, residence time, heating rate, reactant concentration, and aqueous quality. The chemical reaction mechanisms involved in the formation of hydrochar derived from single components and representative feedstock, lignocellulose, and sludge termed as N-free and N-rich biomass, were elucidated and summarized to better understand the hydrochar formation process. Speciﬁcally, hydrochar physicochemical characteristics such as surface chemistry and structure were investigated. Current knowledge gaps, and new perspectives with corresponding recommendations were provided to further exploit the great potential of the HTC technique and more practical applications for hydrochar in the future.},

	abstract = {Because of the rapid growth of global population and economic activity, sewage sludge management is a global conundrum. Conventional landfilling and land-farming of sewage sludge receives increasing critiques due to the negative impacts on environmental sustainability and economic viability. Recently, the thermochemical conversion processes have attracted more and more attentions in sewage sludge treatment, which aims to reduce the volume of sewage sludge and recover of value-added energy and materials. However, the thermochemical conversion involves multiple processes and usually requires a high temperature, which brings many challenges to the large-scale application. Therefore, comprehensive reviews of thermochemical conversion of sewage sludge towards enhanced value-added energy and materials recovery is conducted. Firstly, the composition of sewage sludge and its recovery potential are briefly introduced. Then, a unique analysis of thermochemical conversion of sewage sludge towards value-added energy and materials recovery is elucidated with a focus on the challenges. Ideally, approaches for further sewage sludge management should allow achieving both environmental and economic sustainability. In this instance, varied value-added energy (e.g., thermal energy, combustible gases, H2-rich gas, and bio-oils) and materials (e.g., biochar-based functional materials and ash to value-added materials) recovery from sewage sludge are analyzed. Meanwhile, the environmental assessment of thermochemical conversion technologies is evaluated. The further perspectives and recommendations are also outlined. These insights provide further perspectives and recommendations for enhanced sewage sludge management.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge, the inevitable by-product of municipal wastewater treatment plant operation, is a key issue in many countries due to its increasing volume and the impacts associated with its disposal. Thermochemical processing offers a new way of managing sewage sludge, not only by providing effective volume reduction, but also enabling transformation of carbon-rich organic fraction into valuable energy and fuel. Owing to some unique properties, sewage sludge differs from other solid fuels such as lignocellulosic biomass and coal, making its thermochemical conversion application somewhat complicated and challenging. This paper reviews the options of converting sewage sludge to energy and fuel via three main thermochemical conversion processes namely pyrolysis, gasification and combustion. The fundamental aspects of sewage sludge and its behaviour in each of thermochemical process are summarised. The challenges in adopting thermochemical conversion technology in sewage sludge management are addressed, and various alternative approaches deserving further consideration, such as the incorporation of pre-processing and co-utilisation, are discussed.},

The HTC signiﬁcantly accumulated P in the hydrochar. Diﬀerent feedwater pH stimulated the transformation of various forms of P. An acidic feedwater pH promoted the transformation of apatite phosphorus (AP) to non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP), and of organic P (OP) to inorganic P (IP). The NAIP tended to transformation to AP and a small part of the IP was transformed to OP when the SS was treated in a basic environment. The combination of three P analysis methods (chemical extractive fractionation, X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)) showed that metal cations (e.g. Al and Ca) and the pH played important roles in the transformation of diﬀerent forms of P during the HTC of the SS.},

This study investigates the speciation of Fe, P, and S during sequential HT–AD treatment of sewage sludge using sequential chemical extraction, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Results suggest strong correlations between Fe and P species as well as Fe and S species, affecting the solubility and bioavailability of each other. For instance, much vivianite formed in the hydrochars after HT treatment at low temperature, while more strengite precipitated at higher HT temperature. During the subsequent AD process, microbial reduction of strengite and other Fe(III) species led to the formation of more vivianite, with concurrent P release into the solution and adsorption onto other minerals. HT pretreatment of sewage sludge had a weak effect on the sulfidation of Fe during the AD process. This work has important implications for understanding the nutrient speciation and availability in sludge-derived hydrochars and AD solids. It also provides fundamental knowledge for the selection and optimization of HT pretreatment conditions for enhanced resource recovery through sequential HT–AD process.},

With ferric sludge mixing, the generated MBC contained paramagnetic Fe3O4, showed a smaller diameter of approximately 200 nm, a smaller pore size, a larger specific surface area and a higher carbonization degree than BC prepared using a single biological sludge process under the same HTC conditions. Additionally, biochar and Fe3O4 in the MBC were found to be tightly combined through chemical bonding, imparting MBC with its own property of magnetic recycling. The stable high Methylene Blue (MB) degradation performance in a Fenton reaction after recycling designated it as a good catalyst. The MB degradation pathway was proposed based on GC–MS results. When the MBC was used to treat actual dyeing wastewater through a Fenton process, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiencies reached 47 ± 3.3\% and 49 ± 2.7\%, respectively. Therefore, MBC could be recycled as a catalyst in dyeing wastewater treatment. And a methodology is described that minimizes the produced sludge and enables sludge internal recycling in a dyeing wastewater treatment plant.},

	abstract = {Phosphate rock, a finite and non-renewable resource on earth, is facing the dilemma of resource depletion and quality decline, thus it is urgent to fully utilize any potential phosphorus resources. In this paper, a novel process combined alkaline leaching and crystallization for phosphorus recovery from the leaching residue of monte­ brasite (LRM) was proposed. The main component of LRM was determined to be AlPO4. Thermodynamic study of the Al3+-PO43--H2O system was carried out, which revealed that the complete dissolution region of AlPO4 were pH {\textless} 0.8 and pH {\textgreater} 12.2. Using NaOH as the leaching agent, a series of single factor experiments were conducted to determine the optimal leaching parameters. The results demonstrated that the extraction rates of P, Al and Si were 89.40\%, 86.49\% and 23.33\%, respectively, at leaching temperature of 60 ◦C, leaching time of 1 h, liquid-tosolid ratio of 12 mL/g and NaOH concentration of 120 g/L. Moreover, phosphate in leach liquor was recovered in the form of Na3PO4 by crystallization. The recovery rate of P in leach liquor reached 95.72\% at 5 ◦C for standing 24 h, whereas only 6.51\% of Al was lost. The process proposed in this study provides the possibility of extracting phosphorus from a new potential phosphorus resource.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential and limited resource. Municipal wastewater is a promising source of P via reuse and could be used to replace P derived from phosphate rocks. The agricultural use of sewage sludge is restricted by legislation or is not practiced in several European countries due to environmental risks posed by organic micropollutants and pathogens. Several technologies have been developed in recent years to recover wastewater P. However, these technologies target different P-containing flows in wastewater treatment plants (effluent, digester supernatant, sewage sludge, and sewage sludge ash), use diverse engineering approaches and differ greatly with respect to P recycling rate, potential of removing or destroying pollutants, product quality, environmental impact and cost. This work compares 19 relevant P recovery technologies by considering their relationships with existing wastewater and sludge treatment systems. A combination of different methods, such as material flow analysis, damage units, reference soil method, annuity method, integrated cost calculation and a literature study on solubility, fertilizing effects and handling of recovered materials, is used to evaluate the different technologies with respect to technical, ecological and economic aspects. With regard to the manifold origins of data an uncertainty concept considering validity of data sources is applied. This analysis revealed that recovery from flows with dissolved P produces clean and plant-available materials. These techniques may even be beneficial from economic and technical perspectives under specific circumstances. However, the recovery rates (a maximum of 25\%) relative to the wastewater treatment plant influent are relatively low. The approaches that recover P from sewage sludge apply complex technologies and generally achieve effective removal of heavy metals at moderate recovery rates ({\textasciitilde}40–50\% relative to the WWTP input) and comparatively high costs. Sewage sludge ash is the most promising P source, with recovery rates of 60–90\% relative to the wastewater P. The costs highly depend on the purity requirements of the recycled products but can be kept comparatively low, especially if synergies with existing industrial processes are exploited.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) recovery from sewage sludge (SS) have been regarded as an effective method of P recycling. The effects of incineration temperature, incineration time, and chlorine additives on the distribution of P speciation during sludge incineration were studied. Moreover, the reactions between model compounds AlPO4 and additives (MgCl2 and CaCl2) were investigated by thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction measurements. The results demonstrated that the increase in temperature and time stimulated the volatilization of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) instead of apatite phosphorus (AP). MgCl2 and CaCl2 can greatly promote the conversion of NAIP to AP. Additionally, AlPO4 reacted with MgCl2 are incinerated at 500–600 °C to form Mg3(PO4)2, which is mainly due to the reaction of the intermediate product MgO and AlPO4. Reactions between AlPO4 and CaCl2 occurred at 700–750 °C and produced Ca2PO4Cl, which can be directly used with high bioavailability. These findings suggested that chlorine additives in the SS incineration process can obtain phosphorus-containing minerals with higher bioavailability to realize the resource utilization of P in sludge.

In this study, the influence of the incineration temperature on the ash mineralogy and related P and heavy metal extraction using sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, oxalic acid and sodium hydroxide was studied. Results showed that the P extraction efficiency with sodium hydroxide decreased with increasing incineration temperature, related to a decrease in Al/Fe-phosphates in the SSA. Furthermore, P extraction efficiency for the acidic extraction liquids reached a maximum for SSA obtained around 850 °C ({\textgreater} 86\% P extracted). Heavy metal co-extraction generally decreased with increasing incineration temperature, which could be linked to the immobilization of the heavy metals in the SSA matrix. For all extraction liquids considered, the lowest heavy metal co-extraction was found in SSA samples obtained at 1000 °C ({\textless} 21\% total heavy metals extracted). However, the incorporation of P into silicate melt agglomerates at that incineration temperature reduced the P extraction. As a result, an incineration temperature in the range 800 – 850 °C offered a good trade-off between high P extraction and low heavy metal co-extraction.},

The highest mass recovery (73\%) was observed in the lowest temperature, while the lowest (49\%) was obsereved at the highest temperature. Under all reaction conditions, phosphorus recovery values exceeded 80\%, with the dominated fraction of inorganic-P in the hydrochar being HCl-extractable. Although HCl-extractable P is considered a moderately labile P fraction, P phytoavailability assays indicate that sewage sludge hydrochar is an excellent source for P, surpassing soluble P, likely due to its slow-release nature.

	abstract = {Large amounts of phosphorus are present in organic waste, mainly in sewage sludge and animal by‐products. Increasingly, the waste is incinerated and phosphorus ends up in the ash. Sustainable waste management requires the beneficial reuse of phosphorus present in such ash. The first necessary step when recovering phosphorus from ash is dissolution by acid. The objective of this study was to quantify the acid requirement for phosphorus dissolution from sewage sludge ash and animal carcass ash. Both the amount of acid applied and its concentration were varied. Furthermore, phosphorus dissolution was optimized by controlling the pH during acid addition. Elemental analysis of sewage sludge ash showed that it comprised 6–10\% P, 7–18\% Ca, 2–11\% Fe and 3–9\% Al. The elemental content of animal carcass ash was even higher: 18\% P and 30\% Ca. The amount of acid required to obtain {\textgreater}85\% phosphorus dissolution from sludge ash was 0.39–0.78 kg H2SO4 kg−1 ash, depending on the total cation/phosphorus equivalent ratio. The amount required to obtain the highest possible P dissolution within two hours (73\%) from animal carcass ash was 0.69 kg H2SO4 kg−1 ash. Lower amounts of sulphuric acid were required for P dissolution in ashes of sludge from a bio‐P treatment process and animal carcass, compared with the theoretical acid requirement for apatite dissolution. Applying pH control during dissolution resulted in reduced acid consumption (20\%) and enabled more than 85\% phosphorus dissolution from sludge ash at pH 2.0 in the two‐hour dissolution time.},

In the work described in this paper, recovery of phosphorus by acid leaching of fly ashes from co-combustion of sewage sludge with wood in a circulating fluidized bed combustor was investigated. The results showed that it is possible to find a pH range (0.5–1) in which one can extract a significant fraction of the phosphorus from these ashes without precipitation of secondary phosphates. The type of flocculation agent used in the waste water treatment plant where the sludge is formed has a significant effect on the phosphorus recovery. Ashes from combustion of sewage sludge that was formed using aluminium sulphate as flocculating agent released nearly all phosphorus at a pH value of 1. When iron sulphate was used as flocculating agent, this affected the chemistry of the resulting ashes, making phosphorus recovery more difficult. The yield of phosphorus from those ashes was 50–80\%.

This follows the concepts of the sustainable development of waste management and “cleaner production”. At present, fundamental knowledge is lacking on the use of MWAP to recover phosphorus from municipal sewage sludge. In this study, the effect of MWAP parameters (temperature, power, and residence time) and additives on the properties of phosphorus-enriched biochar and the migration and transformation of phosphorus were investigated. The pH, surface area, and total phosphorous increased with increasing temperature and power, whereas a greater residence time promoted the conversion of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) into apatite inorganic phosphorous (AP). CaO addition promoted the conversion of NAIP into AP, whereas MgCl2 promoted the conversion of AP into NAIP. The simultaneous addition of CaO and MgCl2 led to antagonism, with CaO being dominant, demonstrating that the original phosphorus components prefer to combine with CaO. Phosphorus recovery was optimal at temperatures 500–600 °C and a residence time of 150 min. The addition of 9\% CaO or 6\% CaO +6\% MgCl2 was sufficient to convert sewage sludge into phosphorus into AP. Under such conditions, AP contents in phosphorus-enriched biochar increased 1.4 times compared to that of additive-free biochar. Our study highlights the potential of MWAP for closing the phosphorus cycle and for producing fertilizers from complex materials, such as municipal sewage sludge.},

However, signiﬁcant amounts of P are functionally lost when wastewater byproducts, such as biosolids or sewage sludge incinerator ash (SSA), are not beneﬁcially reused. Around 20\% of sewage sludge produced in the US is incinerated and nearly 25\% of sewage sludge is incinerated in European Union member countries. SSA contains signiﬁcant amounts of P (up to 14\% total P) and other beneﬁcial elements but is typically sent to landﬁlls for disposal. However, SSA has also been explored as one method of capturing and redirecting P back into the food system. Research investigating SSA characterization, P availability, and contaminant concentrations and behavior in soil is required to understand the effects of SSA land application on soil chemical properties and crop production. Several approaches for recovering P from SSA have been investigated that consider these factors. Ultimately, the opportunity for land application of SSA depends on the individual characteristics of a given SSA, ex. total P and contaminant concentrations, and the requirements and regulations of the region where it is produced and applied. In this review, we address the history of P recovery from SSA and discuss research regarding characterization, contaminants, P availability, and land application of SSA.},

In this study, we consider P recovery products as the entry point to analyze the status of P recovery from four perspectives: raw material sources, production processes, product applications, and end markets. Currently, the most feasible path is to recover P from incinerated sludge ash, rather than from the aqueous phase or sewage sludge via recycling. The differences in P recovery products also lead to differences in products; in addition to traditional use in agriculture, the products also have potential industry applications. Therefore, the differences in P recovery products significantly determine the sustainability of P recovery practices. Finally, we believe that government support and public participation will greatly pro­ mote the sustainable production and consumption of P and facilitate the structural reform of both supply-side and demand-side of the P recovery market to accelerate the commercialization of P recovery products.},

	abstract = {The drivers for increasing incineration of sewage sludge and the characteristics of the resulting incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) are reviewed. It is estimated that approximately 1.7 milliontonnes of ISSA are produced annually world-wide and is likely to increase in the future. Although most ISSA is currently landfilled, various options have been investigated that allow recycling and beneficial resource recovery. These include the use of ISSA as a substitute for clay in sintered bricks, tiles and pavers, and as a raw material for the manufacture of lightweight aggregate. ISSA has also been used to form high density glass–ceramics. Significant research has investigated the potential use of ISSA in blended cements for use in mortars and concrete, and as a raw material for the production of Portland cement. However, all these applications represent a loss of the valuable phosphate content in ISSA, which is typically comparable to that of a low grade phosphate ore. ISSA has significant potential to be used as a secondary source of phosphate for the production of fertilisers and phosphoric acid. Resource efficient approaches to recycling will increasingly require phosphate recovery from ISSA, with the remaining residual fraction also considered a useful material, and therefore further research is required in this area.},

	abstract = {Incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) is produced worldwide where incineration is used to manage sewage sludge. ISSA contains significant amounts of phosphorus (P) with high recovery potential, and may contribute to mitigate the global P supply problem. This study reviews P transformation in sewage sludge incineration, the characteristics of the resultant ISSA and processes for P recovery from ISSA focusing on wet-extraction methods due to their greater feasibility. The major drawback of the wet-extraction method is the co-dissolution of metal(loid)s. Hence, purification of the P-extract is necessary to produce a P fertilizer. Based on the analysis, three recommendations are made for further studies. One is optimizing the extraction process to produce a P-extract with a high content of P and low contents of impurities. The second is to develop a plant-available adsorption media, which can selectively adsorb P from the acid-extract of ISSA making the P-laden media as P fertilizers directly. The third is to form a high-purity P product that would be cost-competitive and attractive for use in diverse sectors. Finally, since the criteria for recovered phosphate fertilizer is incomplete, the agronomic effectiveness of newly produced P fertilizer from ISSA should be evaluated prior to large scale applications.},

In this study, addition of chemicals to sewage sludge (SS) prior to incineration was investigated for its influence on the ash mineralogy and related P and heavy metal extraction using sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid. The additives selected consisted of Al, Ca, Fe, Mg and Na chlorides, sulfates and carbonates. Results showed that the addition of chemicals to SS prior to incineration changed the P mineralogy in the SSA, but this had generally almost no effect on the P extraction efficiency. The only exception was the addition of calcium chloride, sodium chloride or carbonates, which decreased the P extraction efficiency. Conversely, addition of chemicals to SS prior to incineration significantly affected the extraction of heavy metals from the SSA. Overall, the addition of aluminum chloride, iron(III) chloride, magnesium chloride or aluminum sulfate to SS prior to incineration offered the best trade-off between high P extraction and low heavy metal co-extraction.},

	abstract = {Increase of sewage sludge (SS) has led to the construction of more incineration plants, exacerbating to the production of SS incineration residues. However, few studies have considered the mass balance of elements in large-scale SS incineration plants, affecting the residues treatment and utilization. In this study, flow analysis was conducted for major and trace elements in the SS, the fly ash (sewage sludge ash, SSA) and bottom ash from two large-scale SS incineration plants. The elemental characteristics were compared with those of coal fly ash (CFA), and air pollution control residues from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWIA), as well as related criteria. The results showed that the most abundant major element in SSA was Si, ranging from 120 to 240 g/kg, followed by Al (76–348 g/kg), Ca (26–113 g/kg), Fe (35–80 g/kg), and P (26–104 g/kg), and the trace elements were mainly Zn, Ba, Cu, and Mn. Not all the major elements were derived from SS. Most trace elements in the SS incineration residues accounted for 82.4\%–127\% of those from SS, indicating that SS was the main source of trace elements. The partitioning of heavy metals in the SS incineration residues showed that electrostatic precipitator ash or cyclone ash with high production rates were the major pollutant sinks. The differences in some major and trace elements could be indicators to differentiate SSA from CFA and MSWIA. Compared with related land criteria, the pollutants in SSA should not be ignored during disposal and utilization.},

	abstract = {Thermal treatments of phosphorus (P)-rich sewage sludge for efficient P reclamation have recently gained much attention. Our recent research proposed a low-temperature combustion method that can simultaneously target safe waste disposal, fly ash volume reduction, heavy-metal stabilization, P recovery, and energy reuse. To further optimize treatment conditions and gain deeper insights into P speciation, this study systematically characterized P transformation during low-temperature co-combustion of sewage sludge with biowaste by combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy, sequential extraction, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses. Organic P, phytic acid, and pyrophosphate in the raw feedstock transformed into orthophosphate during low-temperature combustion. With increasing mass fraction of biowaste, low-temperature co-combustion increased the relative abundance of Ca-associated P and decreased the abundance of Fe-associated P. The dominant P species in the produced bottom ash is strongly correlated to the amount and speciation of metals in the feedstock and their affinities to P. The introduction of biowaste altered the enrichment efficiency and availability of P in the ash. The results from this study revealed the effects of combustion conditions and feedstock characteristics on P speciation and provided a fundamental basis for guiding the optimization of the thermal treatment method for eliminating hazardous wastes, reusing energy, and improving P reclamation efficiency.},

This study considered the P recovery potential of poultry manure ash, sewage sludge ash and meat and bone meal ash through wet chemical extraction. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that these three ash types had a distinct P mineralogy. If inorganic acids were used for the extraction, the P extraction efficiency was not or only slightly affected by the P mineralogy. Contrarily, for the organic acids, alkaline extraction liquid and chelating agents considered, the P extraction efficiency was highly affected by the P mineralogy, and was also affected by the elemental composition of the ash and/or the chemical characteristics of the extraction liquids. Alkaline extraction liquids showed in general low heavy metal co-extraction, in contrast to the inorganic acids. From an economic point of view, of all extraction liquids considered, sulfuric acid was the most interesting to extract P from all three ash types. Oxalic acid could be a more sustainable option for P extraction from sewage sludge ash. In addition, extraction of poultry manure ash with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid showed a relatively high P extraction efficiency combined with relatively low heavy metal co-extraction.

This study aims to determine the effect of fuel ash composition, chemical association, and combustion technology on the fate of P in ashes from the combustion of sewage sludge and biomass blends to enable more efficient P recovery from combustion ashes. Experiments were performed in a fixed bed pellet burner (20 kW), combusting two sewage sludge blends and three biomass blends of similar fuel ash composition but with different P source (sewage sludge, dried distiller’s grain with solubles, or phosphoric acid). Slag, bottom ash, and particulate matter samples were collected and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction for morphology and elemental and crystalline phase composition and compared to results from experiments in fluidized bed combustion using the same fuel blends reported separately. The distribution and elemental composition of ash fractions indicated that sub-micrometer particles contained a minor share of fuel P, with the significant share of fuel P found in the slag and bottom ash fractions. No apparent difference in phosphate speciation could be observed between the slag and bottom ash from sewage sludge blends and biomass blends, with a range of crystalline Ca, Mg, and K phosphates detected in the ash. By comparison, only Ca-rich phosphates were detected in the ashes from the combustion of the sewage sludge blends in the bench-scale fluidized bed. The difference in P speciation between the technologies was attributed to a difference in the process temperature between the two technologies. In comparison to fluidized bed combustion, fixed bed combustion favored the formation of (Ca, Mg)–K phosphates rather than Ca phosphates for similar fuel blends.},

	abstract = {Incineration is a promising disposal method for sewage sludge (SS), enriching more than 90\% of phosphorus (P) in the influent into the powdered product, sewage sludge ash (SSA), which is convenient for further P recovery. Due to insufficient bioavailable P and enriched heavy metals (HMs) in SSA, it is limited to be used directly as fertilizer. Hence, this paper provides an overview of P transformation in SS incineration, characterization of SSA components, and wet-chemical and thermochemical processes for P recovery with a comprehensive technical, economic, and environmental assessment. P extraction and purification is an important technical step to achieve P recovery from SSA, where the key to all technologies is how to achieve efficient separation of P and HMs at a low economic and environmental cost. It can be clear seen from the review that the economics of P recovery from SSA are often weak due to many factors. For example, the cost of wet-chemical methods is approximately 5∼6 €/kg P, while the cost of recovering P by thermochemical methods is about 2∼3 €/kg P, which is slightly higher than the current P fertilizer (1 €/kg P). So, for now, legislation is significant for promoting P recovery from SSA. In this regard, the relevant experience in Europe is worth learning from countries that have not yet carried out P recovery from SSA, and to develop appropriate policies and legislation according to their own national conditions.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludge mono-incineration with subsequent phosphorus (P) recovery from the ash is becoming increasingly important in many European countries. Plant operators are facing the challenge to produce a homogeneous P output which needs to conform to fertilizer standards (including trace elements levels) upon processing. This needs to take into account (i) the compositional variability of municipal sewage, (ii) design of incinerator and phosphorus recovery unit, and (iii) logistical and management aspects. In this study, those challenges were considered in Monte Carlo simulations based on a discretized sewage sludge input. To propagate the uncertainty along the entire process chain of thermal sewage sludge treatment and P-recovery, a simulation model was implemented using MATLAB. Specifically, logistical factors, different management options along the treatment chain, technical boundary conditions were investigated and the distribution of the P2O5 concentrations in the output (fertilizer/ash) was calculated. The results show how appropriate handling and treatment of sewage sludge helps to reduce the width product properties (e.g. P2O5 distribution, trace metal distribution in the output. From the options tested, storage management (including automated crane operation) had the strongest homogenization effect and could be easily implemented at incinerator sites.},

	abstract = {The treatment of significant amounts of municipal sewage sludge requires novel and efficient technologies. This study evaluated hydrothermal liquefaction as a means to sustainably convert sludge waste into a renewable energy source – biocrude, which can mitigate both environmental and energy-related challenges. Response surface methodology was employed to investigate the effects of reaction temperature (290–360 ◦C) and residence time (0–30 min) on product yield and biocrude quality. Both the highest and the lowest reaction temperature or residence time had negative effects on biocrude yield and energy recovery (ER), while high reaction severities improved biocrude quality. Under optimized conditions (332 ◦C for 16.9 min), biocrude yield (48.9\%, dry ashfree) and ER (70.8\%) were maximized. Biocrude composition followed the order of N-heterocycles {\textgreater} O-het­ erocycles {\textgreater} hydrocarbons, while nitrogenous compounds reduced, and hydrocarbons increased with reaction temperature. More distillable fractions in biocrude were also produced at higher reaction severities. The possible reaction pathways of biocrude formation were discussed and updated to include catalytic effects on inherent metals and Brønsted (acidic and basic) sites. The high content of O (7.8–13.1\%), N (4.4–4.9\%), and TAN (48.6–63.6 mg KOH/g) suggested the necessity of biocrude upgrading. Separating and recycling trace metals (e. g., 497–656 mg/kg Fe) from biocrude are necessary to relieve upgrading challenges. C, N, and P were mostly distributed into HTL biocrude, aqueous, and hydrochar, respectively, allowing their recovery. Most metals were concentrated in hydrochar. The results contribute to the advancement of the state of the art in biorefinery, which will guide the design of full-scale HTL sludge treatment systems combining resource recovery.},

Impacts of each option on the following aspects were measured using the ReCiPe methodology, in addition to the total impact: global warming, formation of particulate matter, terrestrial acidification, eutrophication of freshwater, and consumption of non-renewable resources (fossil fuels and minerals). The cumulative energy demand of each option was also estimated. The three options differed in terms of their impact on environmental externalities. The energy demand of DAP production was the lowest, and its impact on global warming was 38\% of decentralized system and 37\% of the centralized system. Production of DAP was associated with maximum mineral resource consumption because of extraction of rock phosphate. The decentralized system had the least impact on eutrophication of freshwater and most on particulate matter formation. Overall, the centralized system had the highest impact score – 2.3 times that of DAP production – followed by decentralized process, its impact being 1.4 times that of DAP production. If the phosphogypsum waste produced in manufacturing DAP is landfilled, DAP production had highest overall impact. The decentralized system was better than the centralized system – impacts lower by 40\%. Change of source of energy from coal to solar power makes the centralized system most favourable option and is thus recommended for implementation.},
